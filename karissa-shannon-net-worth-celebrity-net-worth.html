Later that year, a sex tape of Shannon and her then-boyfriend, Sam Jones III (who is known for roles on the television shows "Smallville," "ER," and "Blue Mountain State") was released by Vivid Entertainment under the title "Karissa Shannon Superstar." Attorneys for the couple initially sent a cease and desist letter to <a href=#>Steve Hirsch</a>, the head of Vivid Entertainment, but sources later told TMZ that Karissa and Sam had accepted an offer in the "six-figure range" to agree to the release of the DVD.</p><h2 id=other-work><strong>Other Work</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Shannon and Jones released a song called "Juice and Vodka" on iTunes.

In an interview with "Mirror," she stated, "It was like the devil was inside of me. I didn't want anyone to know I was carrying an 83-year-old man's child." In November 2007, Shannon was charged with misdemeanor battery after reportedly kicking Kristina in the head several times. Both women were drunk at the time, and a few days later, Kristina decided against pressing charges. In January 2008, Karissa and Kristina were both charged with aggravated battery. According to TMZ, "The twins went out after work with one of their Wing House co-workers, Erica Civello, to a house party. Kristina allegedly started arguing with Erica, and Karissa came up behind her and hit Erica over the head with a bottle of beer and they both 'jumped her.' Erica suffered a concussion." The twins were put on probation after pleading no contest, and they were ordered to pay restitution.</p><p>In October 2015, Karissa and Kristina were involved in a car accident in Beverly Hills. They were both treated for injuries at a local hospital, and Kristina was charged with DUI. After fighting with each other in May 2017, both twins were arrested, Karissa for felony domestic violence and Kristina for misdemeanor violence. TMZ reported, "Cops say Kristina and Karissa had gotten into a violent brawl after a night of drinking. We're told Kristina punched Karissa in the face, and Karissa picked up an ADT security monitor and threw it at her sister â€¦ knocking out teeth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLiivsisqpplo52ur7rOp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-pattinson-s-abs-are-fake-kristen-stewart-jealous-he-might-cheat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Pattinsons abs are fake; Kristen Stewart jealous he might cheat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ian-harding-admitted-to-crushing-on-a-co-star-he-once-had-an-argument-with.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Ian Harding Admitted to Crushing on a Co-Star He Once Had an Argument With</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
