What is his net worth after over <a href=#>half a century of rock-and-roll fame</a>? Keep reading on to learn more about this American Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Neil-Diamond-2.jpg><p id=par-3_116>Neil Diamond was born on January 24, 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. He spent most of his adolescence in New York, but temporarily lived in Wyoming while his father served in the military. At the age of 16, Diamond got his first guitar and began writing his own songs and music. “At about 16, I took guitar lessons, then piano. I didn’t take it seriously, though, until I started writing songs, and even then I didn’t think it was something I’d do for the rest of my life,” <a href=#>Diamond told Newsweek</a>. He earned a scholarship to New York University and began to pursue a pre-medical track, but continued to write and compose music on the side.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_79>Diamond dropped out of New York University in the 1960s and pursued a career in music full-time, working as a professional songwriter for myriad companies during his youth. He reached pop rock success with his 1966 single “Solitary Man” and wrote the hit song “I’m a Believer” for The Monkees later that same year. He continued to write and compose his own music, creating chart-topping hit after chart-topping hit, like “Sweet Caroline” and “Girl, You’ll Be a Woman Soon.”</p><p id=par-5_11>On January 24, 2020, Neil Diamond had celebrated his 79th birthday.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_89>By the 1970s, Neil Diamond was a pop rock-and-roll icon, consistently releasing chart-topping hits throughout the years. In 1972, Diamond released Hot August Night, a live album recorded at one of several sold-out concerts at the famous Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, <a href=#>a venue that has hosted legendary talents</a> like Sir Elton John and Frank Sinatra. Neil Diamond once again created another musical hit with “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers”, a duet with artist Barbra Streisand, which hit the No.1 spot on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1978.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_95>A few years later, Diamond moved his talents from the stage to the screen, making his acting debut by starring in the 1980 remake of The Jazz Singer. The film didn’t perform very well, however. Roger Ebert from the <a href=#>Chicago Sun-Times wrote</a> that The Jazz Singer “has so many things wrong with it that a review threatens to become a list.” Fortunately, the film’s soundtrack, which featured hits like “America” and “Love on the Rocks”, performed successfully and The Jazz Singer album sold over 5 million copies and reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_92>In 2005, Diamond released his 26th studio album 12 Songs, which was the “Delirious Love” singer’s first studio album in four years. The album was a collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin and fans considered this album to be Diamond’s official comeback into the music world. “They call it a ‘comeback.’ For me, I never thought that I was away,” Diamond told Newsweek. Diamond’s “comeback” came in strong with the artist continuing to release popular chart-topping hits and touring for several more years. He continued to record and tour into his 70s.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_69>“I’d like just to continue to write songs that express my own life and feelings. Writing songs and performing for an audience is such a satisfying creative outlet that I can’t think of anything else I could do to top it.” Diamond told Daily Variety, “I have no unfulfilled professional wishes beyond that, but the future is unknowable, so I like to keep myself open for all its possibilities.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Neil-Diamond-1.jpg><p id=par-10_69>In the middle of Neil Diamond’s 50th Anniversary World Tour, the artist suddenly canceled the final round of his tour, which would have ended in Australia and New Zealand. He announced that he would be retiring from touring due to his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, a central nervous system disorder that affects movement and coordination, often causing tremors. Diamond released a <a href=#>statement</a> on his official website shortly after, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>“I have been so honored to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years. My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows. My thanks go out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world. You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement. This ride has been ‘so good, so good, so good’ thanks to you.”<br></p><p id=par-11_72>Even though his diagnosis ended his touring career, Diamond still continues to write, record, and even perform his music from time to time. In the summer of 2018, <a href=#>Diamond thanked Colorado firefighters</a> for battling a disastrous wildfire with a special concert for rescue personnel. Earlier this month, Diamond surprised crowds of the Las Vegas Strip by performing seven of his greatest hits, including “Sweet Caroline” and “Hello Again” in a surprise show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Neil Diamond’s net worth?</h2><p id=par-12_39>The “Love on the Rocks” singer is far from singing his swan song, having recently rewritten “Sweet Caroline” to fit the fears and anxieties surrounding the novel outbreak of COVID-19, singing, “Hands… Washing hands” to fans on social media.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_143>“I never expected that I would be doing this for as long as I’ve been doing it,” Diamond <a href=#>mentioned to The New York Times</a> after performing at the XL Center in 2008, “So looking back and seeing that it’s been over 40 years since the first hits makes you think, ‘Is there a time that you stop?’. But I don’t think I’m ever going to stop. It’s the only challenge I have left in my life.”&nbsp; Still, after years of performing and creating legendary songs that will forever be remembered by fans of country and rock-and-roll alike, Neil Diamond remains a musical icon with <a href=#>a net worth of $175 million</a>.&nbsp;<br>The New York Times referred to Diamond as “The Marathon Man of Pop” and it looks like, even after over half a century, Diamond’s musical race is nowhere close to the finish line.</p><p id=par-14_13><strong>Read more: </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>After All The Movies & Albums: How Much Is Elvis Presley&nbsp;Worth?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMqKOdZZmoeq%2BxyKVknaGRoryvsIyapZ1lp52utXnIrGShoaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./magic-the-gathering-reveals-exclusive-cards-for-love-your-lgs-promotion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Magic: The Gathering Reveals Exclusive Cards For Love Your LGS Promotion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-barris-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George Barris Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
