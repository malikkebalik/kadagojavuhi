Mark Wahlberg has definitely had one of the more interesting careers in Hollywood. The original fifth member of the pop juggernaut known as "The New Kids on the Block", Mark left the group and fell into a life of crime during his teens. He was eventually sent to prison, and subsequently decided to get his act together. In the early 1990s, he launched a successful rap career performing as "Marky Mark" in a group called Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. As Marky Mark he put out a handful of successful singles, most notably "Good Vibrations", which was certified Platinum. Around this time he also appeared in a number of successful <a href=# title="Calvin Klein Net Worth">Calvin Klein</a> ads, and a now famous photo spread for Vanity Fair. In the mid-90s, he shifted his focus to acting, dropped the "Marky Mark" moniker and soon found himself enjoying an A-List acting and producing career. As an actor, he can easily command $10 million to appear in a film, but typically accepts lower salaries in exchange for shares of the backend gross. To date, his films have grossed more than $5.4 billion at the global box office. His biggest box office hit is 2014's "Transformers: Age of Extinction", which earned $1.1 billion worldwide. The 2017 sequel earned $600 million globally.</p><p>Some notable Mark Walhberg movies include "Lone Survivor", "Patriot's Day", "Boogie Nights", "Shooter", "The Perfect Storm", "Rock Star", "The Italian Job", "The Departed", "The Other Guys", "Ted" and several "Transformers" movies. Along the way, he has received a BAFTA Award, three SAG Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and has won a host of other honors.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly for his net worth, Mark Wahlberg is a highly successful and sought-after entertainment producer and entrepreneur. Mark has experienced enormous success through his<a href=#> Wahlburgers burger franchise</a> and fitness chain, F45 fitness, the latter which went public in July 2021. As we detail later in this article, thanks to his early venture capital investment, today Mark owns 8 million shares of F45. As of this writing there are around 50 chains of Wahlburgers around the world, and the company generates over $100 million in annual revenue.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354839 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mark-wahlberg.jpg alt width=900 height=620 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354839 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born on June 5, 1971 in Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts.

Through his production company, Closest to the Hole, he executive produced the HBO series "Entourage" (2004-2011), a show loosely based on his own experiences in Hollywood. When the series was active, he earned $3 million per year as an executive producer.

Paul Getty Net Worth">J. Paul Getty</a> biography "All the Money in the World" made the stunning to decision to recast and re-film his scenes with an entirely new actor. As a result, Mark and his co-star <a href=# title="Michelle Williams (Destiny's Child) Net Worth">Michelle Williams</a> were both called back to perform scenes again. A new controversy erupted when it was later revealed that <a href=#>Wahlberg received an extra salary of $1.5 million for his work on the reshoots</a> while Michelle Williams received less than $1,000 for her work.</p><p>In response, <a href=#>Wahlberg donated the money to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund</a>, which helps to cover the legal expenses of women who experienced workplace sexual harassment and have come forward with their cases under the Time's Up movement.</p><h2 id=endorsements><strong>Endorsements</strong></h2><p>Aside from his famous 1992 Calvin Klein partnership, Wahlberg has also served as brand ambassador for a variety of other brands, including health and nutrition brand GNC, where he promoted "Marked," a line of sports nutrition supplements. He also signed a deal with AT&T in March 2017 reportedly for $10 million to be their spokesman.</p><h2 id=wahlburgers><strong>Wahlburgers</strong></h2><p>Wahlberg co-owns, with his brothers Donnie and Paul, the burger chain Wahlburgers.

They began dating in 2001. Together, they have four children.</p><p>Mark maintains a famously spartan daily workout and eating routine. In October 2018, he broke the daily routine down in a series of Instagram posts:</p><p><strong>2:30 am: wake up</strong></p><p><strong>2:45 am: pray</strong></p><p><strong>3:15 am: breakfast â€“ "I start out with steel oats, peanut butter, blueberries and eggs for breakfast. Then I have a protein shake â€” Performance Inspired Nutrition Vanilla Latte Shake â€” three turkey burgers, five pieces of sweet potato."</strong></p><p><strong>3:40 to 5:15 am: work out</strong></p><p><strong>5:30 am: post-workout meal</strong></p><p><strong>"At 8 o'clock, I have about 10 turkey meatballs. At 10:30, I have a grilled chicken salad with two hard-boiled eggs, olive, avocado, cucumber, tomato, lettuce. And then at 1 o'clock I have a New York steak with green peppers. Then at 3:30 I have grilled chicken with bok choy. Then at 5:30, 6 o'clock, I have a beautiful piece of halibut or a cod or sea bass. Some sort of white fish."</strong></p><p>In between all that exercising and eating, he also has scheduled "family time" at 11 AM and 5:30 PM, plus picking his kids up at school in the afternoon.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2001 Mark paid $4.95 million for a home in Beverly Hills. He listed this home for sale in 2015 for $30 million. This house features seven bedrooms and eleven bathrooms, spread out over the 9000 square foot main home and a nearby guesthouse. It sits on almost two acres of land and is surrounded by lush, landscaped grounds, which include a pool with a waterfall, a golf course, a spa, a basketball court, and a personal fitness center. In April 2018, Wahlberg sold the home for $12.4 million.</p><p>For a little over a decade, Mark's primary residence was an absolutely stunning estate in the gated Beverly Park community of Beverly Hills. Wahlberg and his wife bought one of Beverly Park's last-remaining undeveloped lots in May 2009 for $8.25 million. Sitting on 6+ acres, he hired famed architect Richard Landry to design what became a mildly-ridiculous (in a good way) 30,000 square-foot main house. Construction costs alone likely topped north of $20 million. The final product features a golf course, basketball court, large pool, movie theater, and much more. Here is a video tour of Mark's Beverly Park mansion:</p><p></p><p><a href=#>Mark listed this home for sale in April 2022 for $87.5 million</a>. After not getting any buyers for several months, in November 2022 <a href=#>Mark pulled the listing from the MLS</a>. He then <a href=#>re-listed the home just a month later for $79.5 million.</a></p><p>In February 2023 they finally sold their Beverly Park mansion for $55 million. By selling their mansion as Nevada residents, they saved around $3.5 million in taxes they otherwise would have paid had they remained in California.</p><p>In August 2022 <a href=#>Mark and his wife paid $15.6 million</a> for two vacant lots located within the ultra-exclusive gated community called The Summit in the suburbs of Las Vegas. While waiting for a mansion to be built, Wahlberg paid $14.5 million for a 7,300 square foot townhouse in the exclusive resort community in Summerlin, The Summit Club. In September 2023 Mark sold his Summit Club townhouse for $16.6 million.</p><h2 id=notable-film-salaries><strong>Notable Film Salaries</strong></h2><p>As we stated earlier, today Mark Wahlberg can earn a minimum $10 million PLUS backends points to star in a blockbuster film. Below is a list of some of his notable acting base salaries over the years:</p><ul><li><strong>The Basketball Diaries (1995) â€“ $60,000</strong></li></ul><p>A supporting role in a <a href=#>Leodardo DiCaprio</a> film, Wahlberg didn't exactly start at the bottom as far as his film career is concerned. Nevertheless, he was only paid $60 thousand for his role in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>Fear (1996) â€“ $250,000</strong></li></ul><p>A suspense thriller released in the mid-nineties, Fear took Wahlberg's career to a whole new level. Luckily for him, his paycheck also saw a boost. Still not quite the A-B list celebrity he is today, but the $250K he made for the film was certainly nothing to sneeze at.</p><ul><li><strong>Boogie Nights (1997) â€“ $1 million</strong></li></ul><p>A provocative film that chronicles the rise of so-called "golden age porn", Boogie Nights comes complete with a full frontal from the young actor. Perhaps it was worth it, the star earned his first $1 million paycheck for his role in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>Three Kings (1999) â€“ $2 million</strong></li></ul><p>A war story about a treasure hunt, this was the turnaround point for Wahlberg as he actually started to be taken seriously as a thespian. Complete with an equally awesome payday, the actor struck gold, earning $2 million for his role in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>The Perfect Storm (2000) â€“ $1 million</strong></li></ul><p>An American biographical flick about the dangers of working on fish boats, Wahlberg starred alongside <a href=#>George Clooney</a> and scored another $1 million for his role in this film.</p><ul><li><strong>Planet of the Apes (2001) â€“ $8 million</strong></li></ul><p>A new age interpretation of an epic, sci-fi standard, Wahlberg's performance in Planet of the Apes was highly revered and earned him his biggest paycheck yet: $8 million!</p><ul><li><strong>Rock Star (2001) â€“ $6 million</strong></li></ul><p>An excellent year for Wahlberg, this film solidified the actor as a sex symbol as well as a force to be reckoned with. An awesome story about a working man who got the chance of a lifetime and ran with it, the film seems to parallel Wahlberg's career in a number of ways. Either way it goes, he was paid $6 million to play one of the greatest on-screen rock legends of all time.</p><ul><li><strong>The Truth about Charlie (2002) â€“ $10 million</strong></li></ul><p>A remake of the classic film Charade, this film is a romantic thriller of sorts filled with many twists and turns. Well worth the running around, Wahlberg scored an impressive $10 million for this film. Which had been his biggest paycheck to date.</p><ul><li><strong>The Italian Job (2003) â€“ $2.5 million</strong></li></ul><p>An American remake of the British film (of the same name), The Italian Job is a film about a heist of epic proportions. However, his wallet wasn't so lucky. The actor received only $2.5 million for his part in the movie.</p><ul><li><strong>I Heart Huckabees (2004) â€“ $500,000</strong></li></ul><p>A smaller role for the actor, nevertheless, I Heart Huckabees is a brilliant film that certainly enhanced the actor's resume. A small yet vital part of an all-star cast including <a href=# title="Jason Schwartzman Net Worth">Jason Schwartzman</a>, <a href=#>Dustin Hoffman</a>, and <a href=#>Lily Tomlin</a>, this role put a spotlight on his versatility and gave him an extra $500,000 to boot.</p><ul><li><strong>Four Brothers (2005) â€“ $2 million</strong></li></ul><p>An awesome action film with a highly sympathetic story line, Wahlberg starred alongside music greats <a href=# title="Tyrese Gibson Net Worth">Tyrese Gibson</a>, <a href=# title="Andre 3000 Net Worth">Andre 3000</a>, and actor <a href=# title="Garrett Hedlund Net Worth">Garrett Hedlund</a> in this modern day classic. Movie reviews were mostly stellar and Wahlberg also earned $2 million for his role in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>Invincible (2006) â€“ $5 million</strong></li></ul><p>A film geared towards football buffs, Invincible is an inspiring tale that Wahlberg helps to masterfully bring to life in this awesome flick. What's more, he earned a pretty good living doing so. His bankroll increased by $5 million.</p><ul><li><strong>The Departed (2006) â€“ $5 million</strong></li></ul><p>A mobster film that received rave reviews, Wahlberg's supporting role in The Departed invited an additional $5 million into his bank account.</p><ul><li><strong>Shooter (2007) â€“ $10 million</strong></li></ul><p>Another awesome action film, Wahlberg stars as a fleeing Marine sniper in this military themed flick. Once again boosting his earnings, the star took home $10 million for his execution of the character, Bob Lee Swagger.</p><ul><li><strong>The Fighter (2010) â€“ $500,000</strong></li></ul><p>Another action-packed film, this time Wahlberg stars as a boxer who is bogged down by intersectional, personal and professional woes. Despite his stellar performance, the actor took a pay cut to play this role. He was paid $500,000 for his work in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>Ted (2010) â€“ $7.5 million</strong></li></ul><p>Juvenile, shocking, and provocative, Mr. Wahlberg stars opposite a talking teddy bear known as Ted (voice by <a href=#>Seth MacFarlane</a>) in this highly comedic movie. Once again raking in the big bucks, the actor was paid $7.5 million for his role in the film.</p><ul><li><strong>2 Guns (2013) â€“ $10 million</strong></li></ul><p>A thriller for the new age, 2 Guns brought out the big gun, <a href=#>Denzel Washington </a>as the actor's co-star. A great movie with a pretty good payday, Wahlberg scored $10 million for his work in this film.</p><ul><li><strong>Lone Survivor (2013) â€“ $4 million</strong></li></ul><p>Later in the same year, Wahlberg plays a Navy Seal stationed in Afghanistan.
