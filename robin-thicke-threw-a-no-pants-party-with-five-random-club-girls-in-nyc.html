Paula seemingly came to her senses at last and told Robin that she was done with his fooling around, his very public wandering eye/dong and his disrespect. For his part, Robin seemed determined to make things right with Paula – he publicly wooed her back, and after a few weeks, <a href=#>it seemed like they were back together</a> and that the separation/divorce was off. Perhaps Paula was keeping him “on notice” or maybe she really wanted to believe that he could change. I don’t know. But I do know that he will never really change. Case in point:</p><p>Robin Thicke may still be wearing his ring, but he certainly isn’t acting like a husband who wants his wife back! An insider exclusively reveals to Life & Style that on April 19, the “Blurred Lines” singer invited 10 beauties back to his marital home after a night out at 1Oak nightclub in West Hollywood — and he hooked up with half of them.</p><p>“Robin didn’t force anything, but he made it clear he wanted to have sex with everyone there. He was drunk and clearly enjoying himself,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style in the new issue — on newsstands now.</p><p>According to the insider, Robin declared it a “no-pants party” while pouring drinks for his guests, and stripped down to his boxer briefs.</p><p>“All of the girls were sitting on his bed; some of them were naked, and he asked each to kiss him on the lips,” another insider dishes to Life & Style.</p><p>“He kissed five of them in a row. Eventually most people left, but some stayed behind. It was all uncomfortable to watch.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Life & Style]</a></p><p>I mean… I guess if you’re going to cheat on your wife, you might as well bang five women in one night when you drunkenly declare a “no-pants party.” So, do you believe this? I do. I also think that it’s probably not going to be a huge shock to Paula. Since they “got back together” or whatever, <a href=#>they’ve mostly been in different countries</a> (she’s working in Canada, he’s touring). She knows by now that when the cat’s away, the RAT will play. But here’s my real question: if you were getting drunk with Robin (which could totally happen), would you go home with him and four other girls and then take turns with him? That’s pretty gross, right?</p><p>Meanwhile, this week’s <a href=#>Star Mag</a> apparently has a story about about Robin and Paula having a menage a D’OH with a female massage therapist and wouldn’t you know? Robin and the message therapist started banging when Paula wasn’t around.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wenn21297704.jpg alt=wenn21297704 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG5jaIV6e9GomaKmj6m1qq%2FKnpatoKKaxKCtvqemZqiRo8G0q8%2Baqa2xj6y2tbS%2Bn6CvnY%2Bnrq%2BwzqaWnKSll6yotdGlqpihnpS7uq%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sachiko-kuno-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sachiko Kuno Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-not-required-to-split-proceeds-evenly-after-selling-mansion-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Not Required to Split Proceeds Evenly After Selling Mansion, Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
