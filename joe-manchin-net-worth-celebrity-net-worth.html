Prior to being elected to the Senate Manchin was the 34th governor of West Virginia, serving from 2005 to 2010. He was a West Virginia state Senator from 1986 to 1996</p><p>During his time in the Senate Joe has earned headlines for his opposition to causes that are traditionally supported by his fellow Democrats, notably Medicare for All and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. He is also famously opposed to abolishing the filibuster and packing the Supreme Court.</p><p>In 2021 Joe Manchin became somewhat of a national figure for his opposition to <a href=#>Joe Biden's "Build Back Better"</a> plan.

That made him one of the 20 richest people in the Senate.</p><p>Manchin is the founder of a coal brokerage firm called Enersystems. His non-public shares of the company are responsible for roughly 30% of his net worth. According to his 2020 financial disclosure, his shares are worth $1-5 million depending on the coal market. That disclosure further revealed that Manchin received $5.2 million worth of Enersystems dividends between 2011 and 2020. In 2020 his company dividend was $500,000.</p><h2 id=senate-salary><strong>Senate Salary</strong></h2><p>As a senior Senator, Joe Manchin's salary is $174,000.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327092 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joe-Manchin.jpg alt="Joe Manchin Net Worth" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327092 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jim Watson-Pool/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Joe married Gayle Heather Conelly in 1967.
