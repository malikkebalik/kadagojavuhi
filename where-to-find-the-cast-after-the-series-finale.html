Fans will no doubt miss all the stellar performances from actors like Jason Bateman, Laura Linney, and Julia Garner. So, where can they find them after <a href=#>Ozark‘s final outing</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-bateman-is-shifting-focus-to-directing-after-ozark>Jason Bateman is shifting focus to directing after ‘Ozark’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_41>Ozark has become one of <a href=#>Jason Bateman’s most well-known projects</a>, but he’s been cast in a long list of other films and shows before playing Marty Byrde. Perhaps that’s why he’s interested in pivoting away from acting for a while.</p><p id=par-3_37>Following the conclusion of the Netflix series, Bateman will begin working on the film Project Artemis — as a director. And the actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> that directing is giving him “the most pleasure” at the moment:</p><p>“I still love acting, but I think I may love directing even more. A lot of that has to do with everything that I’ve been able to absorb as an actor over 40-some years. You watch what everybody is doing on the set to create what the audience is enjoying, and the actor is just a part of that, but a director gets to play with every department including the acting side.”</p><p id=par-4_48>That doesn’t mean we won’t see Bateman on-screen again. But he may be behind the scenes for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, viewers can anticipate impressive leads in his directed work. Both Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson will star in Project Artemis, leaving plenty to look forward to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-laura-linney-is-working-on-her-next-project-and-focusing-on-her-health>Laura Linney is working on her next project — and focusing on her health</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_26>While Jason Bateman may focus on directing after his departure from the Ozark cast, Laura Linney has already begun working on her next acting role.</p><p id=par-6_49>Following her <a href=#>tenure as Wendy Byrde</a>, Linney is set to appear opposite Maggie Smith and Kathy Bates in The Miracle Club. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, the film will focus heavily on female friendships — meaning Linney will get to flex much different acting muscles than she did in Ozark.</p><p id=par-7_35>Additionally, the actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a> that she plans to continue prioritizing her health. She’s made a commitment to taking care of herself, and she’s sticking to it as she moves beyond the Netflix series.</p><p id=par-8_49>“Self-care is an ongoing, endless skill that I am constantly re-examining and trying to be better at,” Linney said. “Working out now to me is all about health. The fact that you look better is a nice byproduct, but it’s not about that. It’s about the quality of your&nbsp;life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-julia-garner-could-play-madonna-after-her-time-in-the-ozark-cast>Julia Garner could play Madonna after her time in the ‘Ozark’ cast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_53>Laura Linney isn’t the only member of the Ozark cast who already has acting gigs lined up. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, Julia Garner is set to appear in two separate thriller movies in the near future. There’s Apartment 7A, which has already wrapped filming, and The Royal Hotel, which is currently in pre-production.</p><p id=par-10_66>Of course, Garner’s gotten a lot of attention since portraying Ruth Langmore on Ozark and Anna Delvey in Inventing Anna. And <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> recently reported that she’d been offered the role of Madonna in a biopic about the pop star’s life. There’s no word on whether that’s a done deal, but Garner would certainly nail the part. Hopefully, we’ll have an update on her involvement soon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-hublitz-and-skylar-gaertner-don-t-seem-to-have-set-plans>Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner don’t seem to have set plans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ozark-Main-Cast.jpg><p id=par-11_51><a href=#>Jason Bateman and Laura Linney</a> played the Byrde patriarch and matriarch, but Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner rounded out the family as Charlotte and Jonah. Both young stars brought an impressive amount of depth to their roles, and they’re likely to move on to successful acting careers if they choose.</p><p id=par-12_38>Unfortunately, neither star seems to have a set plan after leaving the cast of Ozark behind. IMDb doesn’t have either actor listed for another movie or show — but that just means their options are wide open.</p><p id=par-13_34>Hublitz did tell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY</a> that she’d like to sign onto “a big, raucous comedy movie” next. Perhaps the universe will deliver. We’d certainly like to see how she fares in something more upbeat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-ozark-star-already-joined-the-cast-of-another-popular-netflix-series>1 ‘Ozark’ star already joined the cast of another popular Netflix series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_27>Most of the supporting cast members from Ozark have signed onto other projects, and avid Netflix watchers will recognize one of them in <a href=#>Stranger Things 4</a>.</p><p id=par-15_52>If young Victor Creel looks familiar to you, that’s probably because he’s played by Kevin L. Johnson. Johnson didn’t hold a major role in Ozark, but he appeared frequently throughout the show. The actor brought Sam Dermody to life, constantly falling for the Byrdes’ lies and getting tricked into doing their bidding.</p><p id=par-16_26>Johnson takes on a more serious role in Stranger Things, demonstrating his acting range. Perhaps we’ll see him in other Netflix originals in the future.</p><p id=par-17_28>In the meantime, fans can enjoy his acting — and the rest of the cast’s — in Ozark Seasons 1-4, all of which are streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8u63RpGSfoZ6ZeqSt0q1krJ2inrK0ecWipZqklWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-restaurants-in-omaha-nebraska.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Restaurants in Omaha, Nebraska</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./review-destiny-2-lightfall-takes-a-leap-forward-in-gameplay-and-a-step-back-in-storytelling.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Review: Destiny 2: Lightfall takes a leap forward in gameplay, and a step back in storytelling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
