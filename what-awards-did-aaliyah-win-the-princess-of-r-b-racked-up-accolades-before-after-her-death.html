She was rocking the charts with her self-titled <i>Aaliyah</i> album, a more mature sound from the former teen queen of R&B. The 22-year-old made an impressive feature film acting debut in the Jet Li action flick <i>Romeo Must Die</i> and she just nabbed a starring role in the horror movie <i>Queen of the Damned</i>. But her rise met an untimely end when the Brooklyn native died suddenly in a tragic plane crash in the Bahamas. The memory of Aaliyah lives on in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lifetime's <i>Aaliyah:</i> <i>Princess of R&B</i> TV movie,</a> airing Saturday night, as well as through the 44 <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>awards Aaliyah won</a> both before and after her death.</p><p>The R&B crooner got her start incredibly young — at 11 years old, she performed with legend, and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>her aunt, Gladys Knight</a><i>.</i> How on earth do you top that? Perhaps with a record deal, which Aaliyah scored at age 12 with Jive Records. Her debut album <i>Age Ain't Nothing But a Number</i> took R&B by storm, selling more than 300 million copies and going double platinum. <i>One in a Million</i>, Aaliyah's second studio album, found even more success for the singer, along with plenty of accolades.</p><h3>R&B Artist of the Year</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This is a crown worn many times by the R&B star and awarded to her by many organizations, so it's no wonder people started calling her the Princess of R&B. The American Music Awards named her its Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist in 2002 and 2003. The Billboard Music Awards bestowed on her the honor of Top Hip-Hop/R&B Artist of the Year, Female, in 2000 and 2003.</p><p>In 2002, the World Music Awards named Aaliyah the World's Best Selling Female R&B Artist Of The Year. Her wide appeal even reached Israel, where she took home the Icon Israeli Musical Artist Award for Best Selling International Female Artist of 2004.</p><h3>"Try Again"</h3><p></p><p>Not only did <i>Romeo Must Die</i> kick-start Aaliyah's too-short acting career, but its soundtrack rocketed her name to the top of the charts. This catchy track became Aaliyah's first No. 1 mainstream pop hit. The tune won Best Movie Song from the MTV Movie Music Awards, Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards, and Female R&B/Soul Single from the Soul Train Awards.</p><p>The song was also nominated for a Grammy and took home three Pakistan Music Awards. The music video, featuring her movie co-star Li, won Best Female Video and Best Video From Film at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.</p><h3>"Rock the Boat"</h3><p></p><p>This sensual tune became a big success for the singer after her death. Perhaps it was the connection to her passing — Aaliyah died in the plane crash on the way back from shooting the music video to this song in the Bahamas — or people just lived it, because clearly award shows did.</p><p>"Rock the Boat" won Best R&B Video at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Video at the Music of Black Origin Awards, Best Song from the MTV Europe Music Awards, and Best Female R&B/Soul Single from the Soul Train Awards.</p><p>I can only image what else Aaliyah would've gone on to do if her life hadn't been so tragically cut short.</p><p><i>Image: Getty Images</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx1hJdramavmJbBbq3Wmqmdq12ZtqV5wJqjorGRnXq4tc1mq6GdXaW%2FqrrCnqqsZZ%2BberOujKuYnKOVmXq2vIyampynnJaxpr%2BMm5yfp6KaeqKy056pZqCVpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-gotye-dating-gotye-s-girlfriend-exes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gotye Dating Gotye's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stand-up-comedian-martha-kelly-joins-spider-man-homecoming-in-undisclosed-role.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stand-Up Comedian Martha Kelly Joins Spider-Man: Homecoming In Undisclosed Role</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
