Anissa Aguilar had a thing with Hamudi Hasoon. However, the Truth Booth determined they weren’t a perfect match. After discovering her past with an ex and opening up about a motorcycle accident that left him temporarily traumatized, Aqel realized they could be perfect matches.</p><p id=par-3_51>He found it easy to talk with her and believed he could meet her needs in a relationship. Even though it was apparent they were perfect matches due to the number of beams they received at the ceremonies, Anissa still had her doubts until the final match-up when the cast won.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>Brendan Mosca and Julia-Ruth Smith</h2><p id=par-4_46>After becoming the first couple in the house to visit the Boom Boom Room, Julia-Ruth Smith ended things with Brendan Mosca as she thought he might possess qualities similar to her exes. He <a href=#>moved on with CC Cortez,</a> but the Blackout determined they weren’t a match.</p><p id=par-5_63>Therefore, Brandon gave it another try with Julia and took her on a date. The New Zealand native admitted she didn’t give him a chance due to her past, although she thought he could be her perfect match. Everyone else agreed and voted the couple into the Truth Booth, where they were confirmed, becoming the first couple to move into the Honeymoon Suite.</p><h2>Clay Carey and Taylor Kelly</h2><p id=par-6_36><a href=#>Taylor Kelly came into</a>&nbsp;AYTO&nbsp;wanting to find her perfect match and winning three challenges, the most of any contestant. She initially hit it off with Nathan, but the Truth Booth quickly determined they weren’t a perfect match.</p><p id=par-7_60>Additionally, the Blackout proved she and Hamudi Hasoon weren’t matches. Another Truth Booth revealed it wasn’t Will Gagnon. She eventually began talking with Clay Carey more and realized she could see herself with him. Additionally, Clay enjoyed how much fun they had together. She entered her third Truth Booth with Clay, where they were determined to be a perfect match.</p><h2>Eduardo Dickson Jr. and Courtney Rowe</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_34><a href=#>Eduardo Dickson Jr.</a> and Courtney didn’t appear to communicate much throughout the season. She mainly connected with Will and Hamudi while he spent several match-up ceremonies sitting next to Jordanne Deveaux and Dew Pineda.</p><p id=par-9_50>Therefore, they never coupled up until the final ceremony. In the premiere episode, a slight clue hinted at their future matching. During the premiere episode, Sam Khan won the first date and chose Courtney. In a confessional, Eduardo told the camera he didn’t think Sam could “handle” the UK native.</p><h2>Hamudi Hasoon and Danielle Bonaparte</h2><p id=par-10_30>Danielle Bonaparte and Hamudi were another couple who seemingly rarely communicated. She spent time sitting next to Leo Svete and Will while he developed a strong connection <a href=#>with Mijntje Lupgens</a>.</p><p id=par-11_39>Before the ninth and final match-up ceremony, the contestants participated in speed dating, where Hamudi and Danielle realized they possessed qualities they told the matchmakers. They sat together once during the third ceremony when the group received four beams.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Leo Svete and Roz Odujebe</h2><p id=par-12_36>After hitting it off with Brooke Rachman, Leo reluctantly moved on after the Blackout proved they weren’t a match. He then thought Danielle was his partner until he realized he and Roz Odujebe had a connection.</p><p id=par-13_22>They sat next to each other for three straight ceremonies and were determined to be a perfect match at the final one.</p><h2>Mikey Owusu and Jordanne Deveaux</h2><p id=par-14_27>As Mikey Owusu and Jordanne spent the entire season sitting next to other people, they hadn’t connected until before the ninth ceremony when forced to speed date.</p><p id=par-15_38>During their conversation, they realized they could handle each other in ways they don’t believe others can, leading them to think they’re a perfect match. The two were proven correct at the last ceremony when the group won.</p><h2>Nathan Grant and CC Cortez</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-16_39>After realizing Brandon wasn’t her perfect match, CC paired up with Clay several times as a strategy before hitting it off with Mikey. They finally split as it became apparent they weren’t a perfect match, leading her to Nathan.</p><p id=par-17_30>The two previously talked, and Nathan pointed out that her actions didn’t bother him because he’s secure in himself. However, they didn’t sit with each other until their final match-up.</p><h2>Ollie Andersen and Brooke Rachman</h2><p id=par-18_36>Following Julia-Ruth and Brendan’s exit, the group only got one more light beam. Therefore, the lone perfect match returned to the house, where they talked to the group and threw a couple into the Truth Booth.</p><p id=par-19_43>Believing <a href=#>Ollie and Brooke were a perfect match</a> due to the number of times they sat together and wanting to force Leo to move on, the two put them in and were proven right. Ollie and Brooke became the second confirmed perfect match.</p><h2>Samuel Khan and Mijntje Lupgens</h2><p id=par-20_33>While Mijntje’s relationship with Hamudi was heavily featured in episodes, Sam wasn’t involved much in the show. It seemed he didn’t know his perfect match as he sat beside everyone once except Taylor.</p><p id=par-21_30>By the seventh ceremony, host Kamie Crawford revealed the UK native <a href=#>chose to leave the house.</a> Therefore, his perfect match, Mijntje, had to join the couples in the Honeymoon Suite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><h2>Will Gagnon and Dew Pineda</h2><p id=par-22_34>After discovering Taylor wasn’t his perfect match, Will spent the most time with Courtney. Even though they weren’t a confirmed no-match, the number of beams they received at ceremonies didn’t give them much confidence.</p><p id=par-23_63>Regardless, they stayed together until Courtney discovered Will kissed Danielle on a date and didn’t tell her. It forced him to move on, and the cast realized Dew Pineda and Will were probably perfect matches. However, the two didn’t get along. By the end, they discover they have what each other needs in a relationship and are proven right when the cast wins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSus7GMsqauZaSdsm67zZ5krJ2RqLyveZhmp56qlpqwtXnMmqucoJWoe6nAzKVm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ibiza-spain-shore-excursions-excursion-tours.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ibiza Spain Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Excursion Tours</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-things-to-get-at-costco-right-now-from-costco-employee.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Things to Get at Costco Right Now, From Costco Employee</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
