Mikayla Nogueira is commenting on how difficult it is to be an influencer and how her job is difficult; her exact words were, “literally just finished working, it’s 5:19 — try being an influence for a day, try it.” Mikayla made her original video in reply to a comment where someone told her to try working a 9 to 5 job; it was viewed 1.1 million times.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Mikayla Nogueira in a brand partnership" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mikayla-Nogueira-in-a-brand-partnership.jpg alt="Mikayla Nogueira in a brand partnership" width=400 height=392 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This video resurfaced thanks to Reddit and TikTok, where the video clips were shared; many people used it to show how hard their job was, and people saw her as insensitive and out of touch with reality.</p><p>TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span>@llaurynsimone reposted Nogueira’s video</span></a>, commenting that “most people getting off of work at five o’clock can barely pay their rent, but being an influencer is so hard, y’all,” in an attempt to mock the makeup artist who lives a lavish lifestyle. Many comments and reactions came up against her, a few mentioning their struggles in their work and personal life and how much they wish they could give up their current life to become influencers.</p><p>And Mikayla is not the only famous personality to make this mistake; TikTok influencer Tara Lynn, who goes by @taraswrld, did a similar thing and was faced with severe public outrage; she later came forward and apologized and said she was just joking. Mikayla Nogueira is yet to comment on these backlashes; she needs to do something quick to save her million followers.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Mikayla Nogueira family" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mikayla-Nogueira-family.jpg alt="Mikayla Nogueira family" width=400 height=336 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Born on June 13, 1998, this TikTok star Mikayla Nogueira grew up in East Freetown, Massachusetts, born to an artistic mother, Patrice, who was also an elementary school counselor, and father, Michael Nogueira, the couple together also have a son, Nathan Nogueira, he is three years older to Mikayla, they all come from a Portuguese descent.
