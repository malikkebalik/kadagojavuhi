Sonny an a home for delinquent boys, and Dean was sent there for stealing food when he was younger. Sam was stunned he never knew this about his brother and asked for more information, but Dean dodged his questions. Another murder occurred while Sam and Dean were at the house, so they scrambled to find the culprit before anyone else dies. Meanwhile, Dean looked up an old girlfriend and recalls his time at the house.</p><p>On tonight’s show Sheriff Mills (guest star Kim Rhodes) calls Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) for help investigating multiple murders in her small town. Discovering all four victims belonged to the same church chastity group, Sam and Dean decide to infiltrate by joining the group themselves. When Dean disappears, Sam and Sheriff Mills realize whatever they are hunting has taken Dean too and team up to rescue him.</p><p>Tonight’s episode looks like it is going to be great and you won’t want to miss it, so be sure to tune in for our live coverage of CW’s Supernatural at 9:00 PM EST! While you wait for our recap hit the comments and let us know what you thought of last week’s episode?</p><p><strong>Tonight’s episode begins now – Refresh Page for Updates</strong></p><p>In Hartford, South Dakota a woman locks up the diner. A homeless man sleeps outside and she lays a to go container of food by his side. She hears a noise and looks around. She rushes to her car and then trips. Her keys go under her car and she crawls under to get them. She hears footsteps and crawls all the way under. She charges up her tazer and then the car is lifted off of her. There’s a large guy there and he’s engulfed in blue flames. The creature puts her body in a sewer and closes the lid.</p><p>Sam sleeps on the table. Dean slams a bowl by his head to wake him up. Sam asks how Kevin is doing and he says he hasn’t found anything. Sam asks if Crowley might be lying about Metatron’s spell being irreversible. Dean thinks Crowley is likely jonesing for a hit of blood and may be willing to deal. Dean asks Sam if he’s sick and he says he feels like his battery can’t recharge.</p><p>Sheriff Jody Mills calls them for help. She says she’s had four people go missing and they ask why she thinks it’s their “kind” of crime. She says a witness saw the guy lift an SUV to get to the girl. The guys zoom right over and give her welcome hugs. She tells them she ordinarily wouldn’t believe that someone lifted a car, but after what happened to them…</p><p>A pastor was taken and then an engaged couple and then the waitress. They were all members of the Good Faith church group. She says her church group was all in a tizzy about that group. She says the stuff she saw with them made a higher power seem plausible. Sam wonders if it could be angels harvesting vessels. They ask about the witness and she brings in Slim – the snoozing homeless guy.</p><p>He tells them the waitress’ name was Honor and that she was really nice. He says he heard a noise and woke up and saw a guy lifting a car. He says he was too far but saw a blue light like fire around him. He can’t think of anything else he saw. They thank him for his time and slip him some money. Dean says no white light means no angel. Dean asks Sam if he’s ready to get his worship on.</p><p>They’re at the Good Faith church and have a tour and she asks if they’re ready to sign up. Sam says they like the church but they’re worried because they’ve heard a few members have gone missing. She says they’re praying for the missing and have increased security. They ask if she was close to them and she says they shared an APU bond (abstinence purifies us).</p><p>Sam asks if they can sit in on the meeting and she says it’s members only so Sam says to count them in. Bonnie says she’ll get the papers for them to fill out. Dean asks if he’s thinking dragons since virgins are being stalked. Then Bonnie is back with their forms and tells them to sign to begin their purification. She says it’s a commitment to their virginity. Dean say she can’t unring that bell. She says if he asks for God’s forgiveness and signs the form, he ‘ll be a virgin again in God’s eyes. She says the paper is their clean slate and their chance to be a virgin until marriage. The boys sign and agree. Bonnie congratulates them and says they are both virgins.</p><p>Down in the sewer, Honor sparks up her tazer and looks around. She sees some personal items and a warning sign and then hears a noise behind her. She turns as the noise moves. She begs for it to please stay away from her.</p><p>At the APU meeting, Suzy leads a prayer for their missing friends. Dean looks around until Sam glares at him until he puts his eyes down. She asks if anyone has anything to share. Amy says she has a poem called “sex is a racket and God’s ball is in your court.” Suzy tells her to wait and asks Sam to share. She asks why he’s reclaiming his virginity. He says every woman he’s had relations with has not worked out (they’ve all died…)</p><p>Then it’s Dean’s turn. He says that sex has always felt really, really good but sometimes it makes you feel bad because you’re drunk and you shack up but then you have to say adios. He starts talking about hands touching bodies and the women start to enjoy what he’s saying. He gets dirtier and dirtier and the ladies are all enjoying it a little too much. Sam coughs and Dean finally says it was all just a little too sticky so he wanted his v card back. Sam tells him he overshared.</p><p>Dean says Suzy looks familiar and says they need to figure it out. Bonnie asks Sam how he liked the meeting. He says he liked it but couldn’t help but think of those that are missing. She says Honor was her favorite. She sees one of the women taking something and rushes to correct her.</p><p>Tammy overhears and says she can’t believe that Honor is her favorite and says she didn’t really know her. Sam asks what Honor was really like. She tells Sam that Honor brought Oreos to the bake sale while she made actual homemade ones.</p><p>Suzy tells Dean that she doesn’t know him and tells him she offers individual counseling. She offers him some books to help and he says he’ll walk her home that it’s not safe with a kidnapper on the loose. Dean tells Sam he’s walking the teacher home and Sam asks if he thinks he’s hitting that and Dean seems to think he will be… Dean asks if Sam had any luck and heads off with the APU leader Suzy.</p><p>Sam goes back to Tammy who tells him that Honor is going to hell.</p><p>Sam comes back to Sheriff Mills and tells her that Honor was sleeping with Pastor Fred and Mills tells him that she found out that the engaged couple had also broken their chastity vows. They conclude the creature isn’t after virgins but those that break chastity vows. Sam says that rules out dragons and the Sheriff asks if that’s a thing. Uh-oh –what about Dean.</p><p>Dean and Suzy get to her place and she tells him to make himself comfortable. She takes off her jacket and is in a tight little top. He lights a candle and comes to sit near her. She’s crying and says she can’t stop thinking about her friends and how scared she is for them. She asks him to pray with her and he reluctantly agrees. Sam tries to call but Dean ignores the call. Sam leaves message after message.</p><p>Mills tells Sam he looks like crap even though he was born again today. He asks if she was born again and she says she doesn’t make promises she can’t keep. Mills tells him she just likes church. She said after Crowley she needed some comfort and something that made sense to her. She tells him that he and Dean are something special.</p><p>Dean has the books and watches Suzy bend over. He’s enjoying the view. She piles the books on him and tells him to breeze through them while she heads to the little girl’s room. Sam calls again and Dean takes the call but is distracted when he sees an open door and notices a DVD – Suzy used to be an actress in dirty movies. Sam tries to tell him about the bond thing but Dean hangs up on him.</p><p>Suzy comes back and he tells her hola. She asks why he said that and he says no reason. Then he calls her Carmelita (her porn name). She asks if he’s seen her work and says it’s okay if he wants a new counselor. She says she’s not that girl anymore and that the old her was horrible.</p><p>Dean says he’s seen a lot of awful things but that she’s the thing good dreams are made of. He says that no one else seems to know and he says that she’s unappreciated. He mentions the scene with the tacos was incredible and that he wanted to join a mariachi band just to be near her. She say he’s near her now and then he speaks to her in Spanish. They start to make out.</p><p>Back in the sewer, Honor is running in the dark trying to escape whatever is there. She finally finds a lamp and lights it and then finds Pastor Fred and then the couple. They tell her that Fred is starving to death like they all will be soon. There’s a noise and then the blue flames come and light up the room. They all hide from it. When they look, Pastor Fred’s body is gone and they hear a scream.</p><p>Sam puts on his jacket and he and Sheriff Mills head out to try and save Dean realizing that he broke his brand new chastity vow and that trouble might be headed his way. At Suzy’s (after they break their chastity vow), Dean kisses her and prepares to go. He opens the door and the blue light engulfs them both and knocks them out.</p><p>The girl in the sewer (not Honor) claws at the walls and says she’s so thirsty and there has to be a way out. She rubs her fingers down until they bleed and then sucks on her bloody fingers. There’s a loud noise and the three huddle together. The trapdoor is shut and we see dirt being shoveled over it. They come to see who’s there and find Suzy and Dean. He asks where they are and Neal says “hell.”</p><p>At Suzy’s place they find form the neighbors that there was a flash of blue. Sam shows the sheriff the porno DVD and says he crossed someone off their bucket list. Dean asks if they’ll run out of air and they say no – that the creature waits for them to die and then takes them.</p><p>Sheriff Mills is on the web and gets a hit – she thinks it’s Vesta – the Roman goddess of the virgins. She’s the one who was worshipped by the vestal virgins and says they had to keep their vows for 30 years. She reads that Vesta was in a blue hail of light and that she could use the light to knock out, maim or kill.</p><p>Dean pulls out his spare cell and calls Sam. He says they’re underground then the call cuts out. Sam asks if there’s a train station nearby and says that he heard a whistle. Neal tells them the fireball thing takes the weakest ones first and he says they should serve up Honor since she has a busted leg. Dean says it’s just a sprained ankle and says maybe they should give him up first. He tells Neal to shut up.</p><p>Sam and Sheriff Mills narrow it down to an old abandoned farm near the train tracks. They find they need an oak weapon stained in virgin blood. He says he’s a virgin and she says they need a real one. They go to see Tammy and ask for a drop of her blood. She refuse and calls them pagans and says she’s going to call the cops. The sheriff says she is the cops and pops her in the nose bloodying it. She gets the blood on a hankie and tells her to clean herself up.</p><p>At the farm, the Sheriff and Dean head into the barn. They look around for signs of where they could be kept.</p><p>Suzy spins her chastity ring on the table and Honor asks if she broke her vow too and Suzy says she wasn’t as strong as she thought she was.</p><p>Sam finds the outline of a door and bangs on it. Neal says it’s back for them and Dean tells him to shut up. Sam calls down to them and Dean shouts back up to him. Then Sam is tossed back and knocked out and the Sheriff is picked up by a girl. She holds out one finger and lights it up with blue flame – holy cow it’s Bonnie the virgin recruiter!</p><p>The Sheriff stares at her blue flaming finger and asks her how a goddess acts. She says it’s sort of pathetic and Vesta head butts her. She says before that hippy from Bethlehem she had no problem getting recruits. Mills tells her it sucks to be Lyndsay Lohan. She tells her she adapted and learned to pray and even got a sweater set.</p><p>Dean is trying to break through from the other side and Honor finds a tool in the first aid kit. He goes to work on the screws.</p><p>Vesta ties Mills up and tells her that she has to take what she needs and has to make do with eating the livers of reclaimed virgins. Vesta stabs Mills but then Sam comes after her. Vesta tries to yank out Sam’s liver and tells him he’s no good. She says he’s all duct tape and safety pins inside and doesn’t even know how he’s alive. Dean pops up just then and asks what he missed.</p><p>The Sheriff is packing up to head out. They hug her bye and Dean thanks her for bailing him out. She tells them not to worry about getting the door for her or anything (rude boys)… Sam asks Dean what if there is something really wrong with him. Dean says he just needs some rest. Sam tells him what Vesta said and Dean says it’s an after effect from the trials.</p><p>Sam says maybe he’s just dying. He says he feels like he’s never going to be all right. Dean says he will and they’ll figure it out together. Sam says maybe this is just the way he is. Dean says he can’t let him put it on himself anymore. Dean tells him it’s not him. Then Ezekial pops out and tells him that Sam isn’t ready to hear it. Dean asks how much longer and Zeke says not much.</p><p>Dean changes what he’s saying and says if there is something wrong they’ll figure it out and deal with it. He tells Sam to have a little faith. Sam looks visibly distressed. He walks out. Dean shakes his head.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxno6q9pr7NmquuqpGherOxwpqnZmlhZ4Nyf4ysnJqrn6N6ennEqaCsp5Saenl50aiapGWRo7FurYyhmKucXaW5oq%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-good-doctor-who-s-in-the-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Good Doctor: Whos in the Cast?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julius-thomas-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julius Thomas Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
