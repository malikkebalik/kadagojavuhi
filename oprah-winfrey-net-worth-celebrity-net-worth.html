Today she earns around $315 million per year thanks to her highly lucrative diversified media empire.</p><p>Oprah first became widely-known thanks to "The Oprah Winfrey Show," which debuted in 1986 and went on to air 4,561 episodes over 25 seasons before concluding on May 25, 2011. There's a <a href=#>very simple reason Oprah is a multi-billionaire today</a>, as opposed to a mere multi-millionaire like many of her contemporary television hosts, and it can all be traced back to a simple yet brilliant career decision in the mid-1980s. As we detail later in this article, after signing a seemingly-great contract that paid her $1 million per year, in 1986 Oprah struck out on her own and founded Harpo, Inc. Media, which operated Harpo Productions and Harpo Studios. In short, Oprah began producing her show and then sold it back to distributors. This is the reason Oprah made $200-300 million per year when the show was on the air, which was exponentially more than the $5ish million per year her fellow superstar daytime hosts were making at the time.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey has won numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the <a href=# title="Cecil B. DeMille Net Worth">Cecil B. DeMille</a> Award, and 18 Daytime Emmy Awards. She was also inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Television Hall of Fame.</p><p>Oprah is a generous philanthropist, and she has donated millions of dollars to charitable causes. She founded the Oprah Winfrey Foundation, which supports educational and economic opportunities for women and girls.</p><p>Oprah is the author of several best-selling books, including The Life You Want and What I Know for Sure.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275574 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1040667974.jpg alt width=900 height=665 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275574 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p>Key Facts<ul><li>First became a millionaire in 1989</li><li>By 1995 her net worth crossed $500 million</li><li>Became a billionaire in 2000</li><li>Makes $300 million per year</li><li>Owns $200 million worth of real estate</li><li>Has donated at least $400 million to charity to date</li><li>Is the richest self-made woman in America</li><li>Owns 900 acres of land in Maui</li><li>Owns 13 properties in Hawaii alone</li></ul><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey rose from poverty, abuse, and prejudice</a> to become one of the most influential people on the planet. She was born Orpah Gail Winfrey on January 29, 1954. That was not a misspelling. Her given name was "Orpah," a reference to the biblical figure in the Book of Ruth. As a baby people regularly mispronounced the name as "Oprah" which eventually stuck. She was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi. Her mother, Vernita Lee, was an unmarried teenage housemaid. Her biological father, Vernon Winfrey, was in the Armed Forces at the time of Oprah's birth. He eventually worked as a barber, coal miner, and city councilman. It has been rumored that her biological father might have been another man named Noah Robinson.</p><p>Oprah and her mother moved in with her grandmother when Oprah was a baby. The family lived in abject poverty, with Oprah famously being forced to wear potato sacks as school dresses. So she literally rose from rags to riches.</p><p>When she was six, Oprah and her mother moved to Milwaukee where her mother got a job as a maid. During this period, Oprah's mother gave birth to a second daughter named Patricia. In 2003 Patricia died from cocaine abuse at the age of 43. Another half-sibling, a brother named Jeffrey born to father Vernon, died in 1989 from AIDS.</p><p>When Oprah was 12, she was sent to live with her father Vernon in Nashville. At 13 she ran away from home to escape the abuse she experienced there. At 14 she became pregnant with a son who was born premature and died.</p><p>She initially attended Lincoln High School in Milwaukee but after excelling in a special program eared a transfer to an affluent suburban school called Nicolet High School. After getting into some trouble she went back to living in Nashville. At East Nashville High School she started to blossom. At 17, Oprah won a Miss Black Beauty Tennessee pageant which led to a part-time job at a local black radio station called WVOL working as a news anchor.</p><p>She earned a scholarship to Tennessee State University, where she studied communication. At 19, Oprah left school to pursue a career in media full-time.</p><h2 id=media-career><strong>Media Career</strong></h2><p>Oprah became the first black female news anchor at WLAC-TV in Nashville. She was also the youngest anchor in the station's history. When she was 22 she was hired by a station in Baltimore called WJZ to co-anchor the six o'clock news, a coveted position.</p><p>In August 1978 she began co-hosting a talk show called People Are Talking. By 1980, she was beating the nationally-syndicated <a href=# title="Phil Donahue Net Worth">Phil Donahue</a> in the local Baltimore market. By the end of her Baltimore run, she was earning $220,000 per year, which is the same as around $560,000 today after adjusting for inflation.</p><p>Recognizing her potential, in 1984 ABC gave Oprah her very own 30-minute morning talk show in Chicago to be produced by a company called King World Productions. King World was also the production studio behind Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. The job came with a four-year, $1 million contract. After adjusting for inflation, $250k per year at that time is the same as around $600k today.</p><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-show-syndication-empire><strong>The Oprah Winfrey Show And Syndication Empire</strong></h2><p>Within a few months of AM Chicago's first air date on January 2, 1984, Oprah brought the ratings from dead last to the highest-rated talk show in Chicago, displacing Phil Donahue. On September 8, 1986, the show was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast nationally, syndicated, and expanded to a full hour. In the beginning, the show only targeted women's issues but was later expanded to cover such topics as health, spirituality, social issues, and charity.</p><p>Also within a few months of the first air date, Oprah began to become suspicious of that $1 million contract. Fellow Chicago TV personality <a href=#>Roger Ebert</a> told Oprah to meet with his agent, a man named Jeffrey Jacobs. In addition to representing both Ebert and his co-host <a href=#>Gene Siskel</a>, Jeffrey also represented <a href=#>Bill Cosby</a>.</p><p>Jacobs was quick to point out that Oprah was unlikely to ever make a single extra dollar as the show became syndicated. He was blunter than that, telling Oprah:</p><p>"<strong><span class=ui_qtext_rendered_qtext>This is a slave contract. Slaves work for a fixed dollar. They're willing to bank on a national show. This contract is for 4 years, totaling $1 million dollars, an effort to make you a highly paid slave."</span></strong></p><p>Jacobs explained how Siskel and Ebert owned a piece of their show's syndication, and how Bill Cosby owned a piece of his show's syndication as well.</p><h2 id=how-oprah-became-a-billionaire><strong>How Oprah Became A Billionaire</strong></h2><p>Oprah fired her agent and sent Jeffrey Jacobs back to King World/ABC to strike a new deal. King World refused to renegotiate. This would turn out to be an extremely fortuitous rejection. Instead of giving over a modest amount of the show's syndication points, King World opened the door for Jeffrey Jacobs and Oprah to accidentally launch an empire.</p><p>While negotiations were cold, Jeffrey and Oprah went out on their own and established HARPO Productions.</p><p>King World was in a tough position. At the time Oprah was attracting record viewer numbers in Chicago and national syndication was looking like a slam dunk. They should have relented and given Oprah a cut of the backend. It would have cost them a few million per year.</p><p>Finally, King World came back to the table but by now Oprah was no longer seeking a cut of the backend. King World executives were shocked to learn that she was planning to produce the show HERSELF. She and Jeffrey, through HARPO Productions at HARPO Studios, would pay all production costs of the show and then they would pay King World a set fee to syndicate the show nationally. King World was now the paid employee.</p><p>Oprah owned 90% of HARPO. Jeffrey owned 10%.</p><p>Next, Oprah and Jeffrey negotiated a much larger overall deal with ABC that included movie productions, a magazine, books, and, most importantly, the right to launch other TV shows under her production umbrella. All production for these shows would take place at her 3.5-acre HARPO campus.</p><p>That's not all.</p><p>Oprah and Jeffrey went so far as to negotiate an ownership stake in King World Productions itself. Thanks to this deal, Oprah would earn money off every show King World produced, including Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.</p><p>In 1999 CBS bought King World for $2.5 billion in stock. When the acquisition was over, Oprah owned 1% of all of CBS. She also ended up owning a significant chunk of Disney stock through a deal she made with ABC in the mid-1990s.</p><p>While her 1980s talk show contemporaries like Sally Jesse Raphael, Phil Donahue, and <a href=#>Jerry Springer</a> would go on to make tens of millions of dollars through traditional contracts, Oprah would go on to make multiple BILLIONS of dollars.</p><table style=height:372px width=444><tbody><tr><td width=185><strong>Oprah Net Worth Milestones</strong></td><td width=101></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td width=185>Year</td><td width=101>Net Worth</td></tr><tr><td width=185>1985</td><td width=101>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>1989</td><td width=101>$1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>1995</td><td width=101>$500,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>2000</td><td width=101>$1,000,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>2007</td><td width=101>$2,000,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>2014</td><td width=101>$3,000,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>2019</td><td width=101>$3,100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td width=185>2020</td><td width=101>$3,500,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When Oprah first crossed into billionaire status in 1999/2000, she became America's first black female billionaire.

When she was brought on to the company, she was awarded $43.5 million worth of equity. That stake has grown to be worth more than $400 million. In 2019 she signed a multi-year deal with Apple to produce shows for the tech giant.</p><p>As an actress, Oprah has appeared in a number of major films including 1985's "The Color Purple," 1998's "Beloved," 2013's "The Butler," and 2014's "Selma."</p><p>She has produced dozens of television shows, documentaries, and miniseries.</p><p>As of this writing, Oprah has been nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Supporting Actress for "The Color Purple" and another as a producer for Best Picture for "Selma." In 2011 she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Academy Award.</p><p>Oprah has won 18 Daytime Emmy Awards (out of 26 nominations), one Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmys, and a Tony Award.</p><h2 id=oprah-real-estate-portfolio><strong>Oprah Real Estate Portfolio</strong></h2><p>Oprah owns hundreds (potentially over 1,000) of acres of real estate in the United States <a href=#>with a minimum value of $200 million</a>.</p><p><span style=color:red><strong>Chicago:</strong></span> From 1985 to 2015, Oprah's primary residence was a 9,625-square-foot Chicago home which she sold in 2015 for $4.625 million.

Today this home is worth at least $90 million. In 2016 she purchased a 23-acre farm estate, also in Montecito, for $29 million. In 2019 she <a href=#>bought the house next door for $6.85 million</a> which expanded her Montecito footprint by four acres.

The 8,700 square foot home sits on 3.25 acres. Built by tech executive Bob Wall, it is a "smart house." If Oprah wants to water the house plants from her office in Chicago, where the headquarters for the Oprah Network are located, she can. It also has a Finnish-style spa and a heated driveway</p><p><span style=color:red><strong>Maui:</strong></span> Oprah bought her first property in Maui in 2002. Over the years she has <a href=#>spent as much as $60 million to piece</a> together 900 acres on the island. She spent $32 million in one transaction alone to buy the property next door. In total she owns 13 properties on Maui.</p><p></p><p>Oprah's property manager had been scouting areas of Hawaii for years, looking for the perfect spot to set up a vacation home. He&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;found a remote location in the countryside of Maui, on a rocky hillside facing the ocean. While there were sparse homes found along the area, her property manager was worried that eventually condos would be built on the remaining space, ruining the&nbsp;scenery. So Oprah threw down and bought up the whole area. She first bought a 9 acre lot for $3.2 million, then 34 acres for $2.9 million and another 6 acres for $2.1 million. And that was just for to preserve the landscape of her new vacation home. She additionally&nbsp;dropped over $15 million to buy up another 102 acres in the Lehoula area of Maui. Some land will be developed for residences and businesses, but most is still undeveloped or set aside for conservation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-252326 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/op2.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-252326 class=wp-caption-text>Erik Aeder/Getty Images</p><h2 id=philanthropy><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>As of this writing, Oprah has given more than $400 million to charity, mostly focusing on educational causes.
