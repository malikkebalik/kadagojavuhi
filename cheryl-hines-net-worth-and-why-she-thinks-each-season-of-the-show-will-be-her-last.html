Kennedy in 2014.</p><p id=par-4_36>She told <a href=#>People at that time</a>, “It feels great because you know you are going to be with the person you really like to be with for a very long time. And that’s a great feeling.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2><br></figure><p id=par-5_41>In a 2018 interview <a href=#>with Closer Weekly</a>, Hines joked about life with her three husbands: first husband, Paul Young, with whom she shares a 15-year-old daughter; Larry David, who’s been her Curb Your Enthusiasm “husband” since 2000; and of course, Kennedy.</p><p id=par-6_35>“Larry David was my first husband, because when I started doing&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm, I was single and had never been married before. Then I married Paul Young, and then I married&nbsp;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.”</p><p id=par-7_11>All men are supportive of Hines and friendly with one another.</p><p id=par-8_19>“When I got a star on Hollywood Boulevard [in 2014], all three of them were in the front row.”</p><h2>Hines says fans talk about human rights and diarrhea</h2><p id=par-9_34>The character actress who’s also appeared on episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond, The Middle, and Fresh Off the Boat, jokes about the different conversations she and husband Kennedy tend to have with various people.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_38>“Someone will come up to Bobby basically in tears and say, ‘What you and your family have done for our country and human rights and democracy has been so important to me and my family,’ ” she said.</p><p id=par-11_32>Then two minutes later, someone will come up to me and say, ‘I remember that time on&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm&nbsp;when you had diarrhea in the car wash, and it really made us laugh.’”</p><h2>Her net worth and why she refuses to Google her name</h2><p id=par-12_14>The mother of one is worth $14 million according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p id=par-13_19>She told <a href=#>USA Today in 2013</a> that she’s learned nothing good comes of looking her name up on Google.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-14_50>“What happens to me,” she related, “and probably happens to most people, is you go down a rabbit hole when you start. . . I’ll look up, `What are the words to&nbsp;The Star-Spangled Banner,‘ and the next thing I know, I’m looking to see how (actor) John Stamos lost weight.”</p><p id=par-15_40>“I somehow went down that rabbit hole one night and ended up watching a video that had been put to music of shots of my feet. I really try not to Google myself — because nothing good comes from it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-16_34>Hines treats each season of the show like it could be her last and that seems to be the way Larry David likes it. She explained the weird dynamic to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight in 2017</a>.</p><p id=par-17_56>“Larry told me from season one that we’re not going to another season,” she recalled. “There have been times when I was frustrated as an actor, like, ‘Are we going to do another season? Should I be looking for another job?’ Larry would always say, ‘Ah, don’t ask me these questions!’ So I just stopped asking.”</p><p id=par-18_11>It looks like, after all these seasons, Hines is a keeper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwtr7BZrCoraJisq%2FAx66qopmjonqktMSrsKVlmJ67pr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJqlnWWnncZuv8eeZK2gmaO4tHnEmpqhZaOarrS7zWamn2WknbJuv8eormavmaG5bq7EZp%2Beql2hrrTAjaGrpqRf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ingrid-bergman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ingrid Bergman Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brent-celek-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brent Celek Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
