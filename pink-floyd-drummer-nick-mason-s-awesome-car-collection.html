Mason is the drummer of one of the most influential rock and roll bands of all time, Pink Floyd. Nick Mason has a net worth&nbsp;of $100 million and is the 10th <a title="The 30 Richest Drummers in the World" href=#>richest drummer</a> in the world. He is the only member of Pink Floyd to remain with the band since they formed in 1965 and he wrote songs for Floyd including "Time," "Echoes," and "Speak to Me." Mason's name is one that constantly comes up when celebrity names are dropped as being owners of luxury cars.</p><p>One of Pink Floyd's most popular songs is "Money" from their classic Dark Side of the Moon&nbsp;album. In that famous song the line goes "Money, it's a gas. Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash. New car, caviar, four star daydream, think I'll buy me a football team." Nick Mason didn't buy a football team but he certainly took the new car line to heart.</p><p>Mason's collection is housed in two hangars at Rendcombe Airfield (a former World War&nbsp;I training airfield) in the English countryside. In fact there are so many cars that they are packed in tight with barely a foot of space in between each one.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-234873 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Nick-Mason.jpg alt width=594 height=411 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-234873 class=wp-caption-text>JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>The most prized&nbsp;car in Mason's collection is his red 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. This was one of only 39 of these cars ever built. It raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans back in 1962 and has raced every single year of its life. Mason values this car so much that he once turned down a $35 million offer for it, which happens to be the base price for this model. He bought the car back in 1973 and only paid $54,000 for it! What makes this car even more valuable to Mason is that he was involved in the most expensive car crash of all time when Christopher Cox totaled his 1962 Ferrari GTO worth $31 million. After witnessing that horrific incident you can see why Mason loves this awesome car so much.</p><p>That car is just the start of Mason's incredible collection of luxury cars. He owns a green Ferrari BB/LM with a flat 12 engine with 440 horsepower that was raced by former Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1980. Mason himself raced his white Lola T297 in the same race. He owns a Ferrari 512S Le Mans that was used in the filming of <a href=# title="Steve McQueen Net Worth">Steve McQueen</a>'s Le Mans and almost toasted racing driver Derek Bell. Mason also owns a Model-T Ford that once belonged to Sennett Studios and was used in Laurel and Hardy movies. The same car later belonged to Coco the Clown before Mason got his hands on it.</p><p>The list of Mason's cars goes on and on. He owns a 1920s Bugatti, a 599 GTO, an F40, a Jaguar D-Type, an Alfa Romeo 8C, a Ferrari Daytona, a McLaren GTR and a McLaren F1, a 1927 Bugatti Type 35 that runs on alcohol, a 1962 Birdcage Maserati, a 1902 Panhard Levassor, and an Aston Martin LM18 Le Mans team car. He even once lent Top Gear's <a href=# title="Jeremy Clarkson Net Worth">Jeremy Clarkson</a> his Ferrari Enzo.</p><p>Nick Mason has a truly amazing collection of cars that would probably double his net worth if he decided to sell them all. He started out his collection a bit more humble when he spent his first band paycheck on a Lotus Elan, which is a pretty cool vintage car nowadays. Once he started making money Mason answered the line from the Pink Floyd song "What Shall We Do Now" that goes "Shall we drive a more powerful car?" His answer was a resounding yes as you can see by this amazing collection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm6vwKuqaKiZo7hussuosJ1llKfCrrnEq2SnoZOgeq6t0qilrGWRrLK0u8yeZJyZomKwsLjLnpqtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stand-up-comedian-martha-kelly-joins-spider-man-homecoming-in-undisclosed-role.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stand-Up Comedian Martha Kelly Joins Spider-Man: Homecoming In Undisclosed Role</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ned-fulmer-still-friends-with-the-try-guys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Ned Fulmer Still Friends With The Try Guys?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
