The club, located in the city’s famed Sixth Street entertainment district, has been a passion project of the comedian for years. Alhough there has been no specific policy announced, many believe that the venue will become a mecca for the “anti-woke” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comedy Rogan favors</a>. In other words, it would be a “safe space” for comedians to break out their transphobic, homophobic, racist, and otherwise transgressive material without any fear of “cancel culture” interference.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Rogan transforms Austin's historic Ritz into an anti-woke comedy club downtown <a href=#>https://t.co/59pwVja0WA</a></p>— Austin Statesman (@statesman) <a href=#>March 9, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true>Rogan purchased Sixth Street’s historic Ritx building to house the club. The location has played host to multiple entertainment venues throughout Austin’s history including a movie house, porn theater, punk club, pool hall, and, most recently, the downtown home of Austin’s local Alamo Drafthouse theater chain. The newly opened club features two theaters, named Fat Man and Little Boy after the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the close of World War II. Decorated with Art Deco and aliens-inspired design, it features some of Rogan’s own alien memorabilia.</p><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Rogan began considering opening a club of his own shortly after relocating to the Texas capitol in 2020. Speaking on Theo Von’s podcast last year, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Rogan said: “I felt compelled to do it. I never wanted to own a comedy club, and I always felt like you just had to be nice to comedy club owners because you never want to be one of those people. But then, when I knew I was moving here, and [Austin’s Capital City Comedy Club] was already closed. I was like, ‘Maybe I should buy a f**king club, and start a club.’ And that became my focus.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Rogan opens alien-themed anti-cancel comedy club in Austin called 'Comedy Mothership' <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NTSZdM9kIo</a></p>— DTN NEWS (@DTNNEWUpdates) <a href=#>March 9, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>The opening night featured a coterie of Rogan favorites including David Lucas, Ron White, Tim Dillion, Roseanne Barr, and Tony Hinchcliffe.
