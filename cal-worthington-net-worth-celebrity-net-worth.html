Cal Worthington was born in Shidler, Oklahoma on November 27, 1920. He grew up very poor. He dropped out of school to work in his early teens, and then went on to enlist in the Army Air Corps. His military service is widely documented, as he trained some of the first astronauts. He began selling used cars after returning to Texas, and subsequently moved to California, where he opened his first Hudson Motor car dealership. He became one of the first businesses to advertise on television, and bought huge blocks of advertising during nighttime movie airings. At his peak his dealerships sold $300 million worth of cars per year and he spent $15 million per year on advertisements. His ads spread across the West Coast, and he became one of the most well known used car dealers in the US. His ads, which were parody style, led to his appearing in movies. He became somewhat of a pop culture icon. He passed away September 8, 2013. In addition to his dealerships, Cal owned a 24,000 acre ranch in Orland, California. He was married and divorced four times and was survived by three sons, three daughters and nine grandchildren.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-333987 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cal-Worthington.jpg alt width=900 height=634 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-333987 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jeff Gritchen/Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeTlrluw86rq6GhnpzBsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-dryer-lint-be-composted.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can dryer lint be composted?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-k-pop-idols-who-look-younger-than-their-real-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 K-pop idols who look younger than their real age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
