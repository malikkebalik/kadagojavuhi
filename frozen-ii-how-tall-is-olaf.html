But we admit we looked forward to its highly anticipated sequel, <a href=#>Frozen II</a>.</p><p id=par-2_65>The <a href=#>Disney</a> animated film follows the Snow Queen, Elsa (Idina Mezel), as she embarks on an adventure with her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), and their trio of guys — Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Olaf the snowman (Josh Gad), and Sven the reindeer. This time around, we get a lot more backstory about Anna and Elsa as the group of five heads off to the Enchanted Forest.</p><p id=par-3_19>However, Frozen II fans lost their minds when they thought they learned Olaf’s height. It was a super-disturbing measurement.</p><h2 id=h-olaf-s-height-in-frozen-ii-sent-the-internet-into-a-flurry>Olaf’s height in ‘Frozen II’ sent the internet into a flurry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Olaf-height-olaf-presents.jpeg><p id=par-4_40>We all thought he was pintsized in the first two Frozen <a href=#>movies</a>. But then an errant fact kicked up a snowstorm. In some bizarre world, Olaf was supposedly 5 feet 4 inches tall, and the error snowballed on social media.</p><p id=par-5_20>One fan asked the most crucial question on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>: “IF OLAF IS 5’4 THAN HOW TALL ARE THE HUMAN CHARACTERS?????????”</p><p id=par-6_20>Another Twitter user quipped, “Bish hold UP. You’re telling me that everyone in the movie was over 6 feet tall?!???”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_23>But our favorite reaction wasthis distraught Twitter user: “if u ever wanna humble me, just know i’m the same height as olaf.”</p><p id=par-8_22>However, it was all a huge mistake. The Frozen Wiki page had erroneously listed Olaf’s height as 5-foot-4, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Know Your Meme</a> reports.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_6>So, how tall is Olaf really?&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/alittlejelee/status/1204607738434609152</p></figure><p id=par-10_18>Jennifer Lee, who co-wrote and directed Frozen and Frozen II, confirmed Olaf’s height is nowhere near 5 feet.</p><p id=par-11_56>“Okay, I keep getting asked about Olaf’s height,” Lee tweeted. “I’m guessing 5’4″ is a typo from something. If it said 3’4″ I’d buy it. How tall is Anna and Elsa? From what I remember, Anna is 5’5″ and Elsa is 5’7”. I could be off an inch or two, but not a foot or two.”</p><p id=par-12_9>And the internet let out a sigh of relief.</p><p id=par-13_22>But, of course, Frozen and Olaf fans have plenty of other things to worry about, like will there be a Frozen III?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-well-will-there-be-a-frozen-iii>Well, will there be a ‘Frozen III’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_35>All signs point to yes. After all, like the original film, Frozen II broke box office records. Though 2013’s Frozen is the highest-grossing animated movie ever, Frozen 2 also racked in the box office coins.</p><p id=par-15_35>The sequel earned $130 million its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada and $228.2 million overseas, the highest-earning global debut for an animated movie. And it has grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> reports.</p><p id=par-16_13>However, whether we get a Frozen 3 might be up to <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a>.</p><p id=par-17_15>“[Kristen] is so talented. She was instrumental to Anna’s journey,” writer/director Lee told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Life</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_77>“I’m so proud that she joined us on saying, ‘Look, Anna’s … you look to her as the optimist, [but] we all go through struggles. I have struggles every day, and I choose to be this way and get up off the floor and never give up, and that was the journey that Anna should have.’ And we agreed. So she’s been an incredible partner in it, so maybe she has a good idea [for Frozen III].”</p><p id=par-19_14>As of this writing, Disney has yet to announce whether Frozen III will happen.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-josh-gad-done-playing-olaf>Is Josh Gad done playing Olaf?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up this morning & had a realization: I may have played Olaf 4 the last time.

But since then, he has voiced the beloved character for the 2020 TV miniseries shorts At Home With Olaf and Once Upon a Snowman and the 2021 comedy series Olaf Presents on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzs7vZnqVmal2kuaKyjKGcop%2BYqXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harrison-ave-covers-lil-dicky-s-romantic-origins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Harrison Ave' Covers Lil Dicky's Romantic Origins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zsa-zsa-gabor-s-widower-must-leave-their-15-million-mansion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zsa Zsa Gabor's Widower Must Leave Their $15 Million Mansion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
