The Isley Brothers claimed that Bolton's song "Love is a Wonderful Thing" was completely stolen from their own song, which had the exact same name and was released much earlier in 1966. In 1994, a Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of the Isley Brothers, identifying five separate areas in which Bolton plagiarized their work.
