One of its most recognizable is the season 5, episode 10 scene, where a powerless Cersei Lannister is paraded around the streets of King’s Landing naked. Ringing a bell behind her and shouting “Shame” was Septa Unella.</p><p id=par-2_49>Six years later, Septa Unella and Cersei Lannister reunited. Well, their acting counterparts did, at least. Hannah Waddingham and Lena Headey (<a href=#>Septa Unella</a> and Cersei Lannister, respectively) have kept in touch over the years. However, Entertainment Weekly publicly reconnected them in honor of Waddingham’s Emmy nomination for <a href=#>Ted Lasso.</a></p><p id=par-3_20>During their conversation, the two friends recalled their first impressions of each other and revealed how close they have become.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hannah-waddingham-lena-headey.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hannah-waddingham-and-lena-headey-met-on-the-set-of-game-of-thrones>Hannah Waddingham and Lena Headey met on the set of “Game of Thrones”&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_46>Septa Unella was famously bare-faced during her scenes. Waddingham recently revealed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Late Night With Seth Meyers</a> that the makeup team on Game of Thrones added eyebrow and chin hair. “I looked like Jar-Jar Binks.” However, that didn’t stop Headey from noticing how beautiful Waddingham was.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_15>According to Headey, the pair met in the makeup chair. The actor immediately noticed Waddingham.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_43>“I think I got the measure of you on our first morning when you turned up looking ridiculously beautiful with a bare face at like 4 AM,” Headey revealed early on in the conversation.&nbsp;She went on to explain she couldn’t stop staring.</p><p id=par-7_39>“I think we sat together in makeup that first morning. I just kept looking at you going, ‘Oh, she’s so beautiful.’” Without missing a beat, Waddingham joked. “And I was going ‘You’re a wanker. What are you talking about?’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-ted-lasso-star-was-impressed-by-headey-s-composure-on-set>The ‘Ted Lasso’ star was impressed by Headey’s composure on set</h2><p id=par-8_29>During the interview, Waddingham admitted that her first time being on the Game of Thrones set was overwhelming. She had just given birth and barely knew anyone on set.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_93>“My first day ever on Thrones was standing on the top of those stairs. My daughter had popped out maybe nine weeks previously, so I didn’t even know what my name was that day. I said to you, ‘Oh, my god! This is so epic.’ [Director] David Nutter was doing his thing, and there were supporting artists everywhere looking crazy. I was like, ‘Oh my god, do you ever get used to this?’ You were so cool about it all, and I thought, ‘I want to be like her when I grow up!’”</p><p id=par-10_19>“I think I was probably terrified of being semi-naked for two days in front of 6,000 people,” Headey laughed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hannah-waddingham-was-nervous-filming-the-shame-scene>Hannah Waddingham was nervous filming the ‘Shame’ scene&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-11_26>While Headey was anxious about filming the scene naked, Waddingham was restless for an entirely different reason. She was intimidated by the Game of Thrones actor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_43>“I was really nervous. I was really nervous joining you on the [shame scene] because you were like Queen Lady of the Ladies and I was some little knobhead that popped a baby out nine weeks previously and was like ‘Hello!’” Waddingham admitted.</p><p id=par-13_22>Headey reassured her friend with, “Well, and then you met me and you realized that I was an equal knobhead. Totally fine.”</p><p id=par-14_14><strong>Related: <a href=#>‘Game of Thrones’: Did Lena Headey Really Film Cersei Lannister’s Walk of Atonement</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1orrNmp9mr5GZsaq6xqGYpmWcmruieceemJ2dqWK6psCMnayroZ6ceqq6xZqkqK2jYrSiucRmpp9lpJ2%2FsLrErGSsm5Wjsm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-lipton-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Lipton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-masterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher Masterson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
