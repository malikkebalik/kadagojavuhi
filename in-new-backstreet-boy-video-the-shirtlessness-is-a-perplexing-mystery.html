(Well, half of them are, anyway.) Throughout the video for "Show Em (What You're Made Of)" Brian Littrell and A.J. McClean are naked on top, and for the life of us, we just can't figure out why.</p><p>Sure, there's probably some level of cheap sex appeal in having just two members of the band bear their chests for all the young women who came of age ogling them in their <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>robot suits</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>mummy make-up</a>. (You know, it's strange to think they had more restraint when it came to shirtlessness as young, dumb mega famous boy band members.) But there's got to be a better reason than "People will think it's hot." There just has to be.</p><p>So we put together some possible explanations for this gratuitous skin-baring:</p><ul><li>Right before shooting for the video began, Brian realized he'd developed a serious cotton allergy — hence the fact that he's holding his shirt in a crumpled ball throughout his performance.</li><li>A.J., feeling majorly bummed about Brian's cotton allergy, rips off his shirt as well in solidarity.</li><li>A.J. was given a crew neck t-shirt to wear in the video, but could not fit the collar over his beard. Brian heard about this and decided it wasn't fair that only A.J. got to go shirtless.</li><li>They were all originally supposed to be shirtless, but at the last minute, Kevin and Nick lost their resolve. Howie was always meant to be the one in a t-shirt.</li><li>This video is a who's who of the most professional Backstreet Boys. Once filming started, the thermostat inexplicably worked its way up to 90 degrees. The true professionals in the group kept the black t-shirts Nick had picked out specifically for them out of professional courtesy.</li><li>A.J. and Brian are prone to nipple chafe.</li><li>A.J. is trying to send a visual love letter to Kat Von D so they can bond over their tattoos. Brian just wanted to show off his sparkly chain.</li><li>A.J. and Brian took the song title too literally. Yes, boys. We get it. You are made of man parts.</li><li>A.J. has actually become a living bust (just head and shoulders) and Brian went shirtless to distract from this.</li><li>They're the two that don't look half-bad with their shirts off and the plethora of black t-shirts on a black background was beginning to make the other Boys look like floating heads.</li></ul><p></p><p><i>Image: Backstreet Boys Vevo</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx6fpZvZKKmXaOyuHnBmpqkq6SnsqbAjJumsmWmnrGmu4ytn55lo522s8DLnqqsppWowG610maYZqiVp72tsdeipaBlna7AtbHRsg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hilton-on-djing-i-ve-been-training-for-6-8-hours-a-day-for-a-year.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton on DJing: Ive been training for 6-8 hours a day for a year</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fortnite-confirms-loki-skin-as-season-7-s-next-crew-reward.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fortnite Confirms Loki Skin As Season 7s Next Crew Reward</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
