The popular show was an American drama television series that revolved around a family who resided in a rural Virginia town near the Blue Ridge Mountains, as they navigated their way through the difficult times of financial depression and World War II. Created by Earl Hamner, Jr., The Waltons was based upon a book and movie both titled Spencer’s Mountain, and it garnered a huge fan base throughout its nine-season run.</p><p id=par-2_77>The <a href=#>show starred actors</a> including Eric Scott, Mary Beth McDonough, Philip Leacock, and more, and having spent so much time together over the years, it is likely that they all had a great relationship. In fact, we do know that there were pranks that went on behind the scenes, and looking back, it would seem that everyone always had a good laugh. Let’s talk about The Waltons, and how two lead actors were always mooning their co-stars.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Waltons-7.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was ‘The Waltons’ all about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_139>Just about everyone has at least heard of The Waltons, but in case there is anyone who is not familiar with the premise of the show, we will do a quick recap. The show was narrated by its creator, and according to <a href=#>Hallmark Drama</a>, it was a family-friendly show that <a href=#>families looked forward</a> to and enjoyed. Each episode told the stories of the Walton family, led by parents John and Olivia, and their children: John-Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Elizabeth, Jim-Bob, Erin, Ben, and Joseph (who sadly died when he was born). During its run, The Waltons won two Golden Globe Awards, plus an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, and the actors won several awards as well. Although the show was fictional, it was loosely based on the life of Hamner, Jr., and his small-town adventures during uncertain times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who were some main characters?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_79>Fans of the Waltons will certainly remember some of the show’s main characters, including those played by Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, and Will Geer. The three of them played Olivia, John, and Grandpa Zebulon (Zeb), respectively, and they never failed to disappoint with their performances. According to <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>, Learned was credited in the show as “Miss Michael Learned” to avoid gender confusion, and her role as Olivia led to other notable roles, both onstage and in productions.</p><p id=par-5_75>It was from his role in The Waltons that Waite rose to fame, and he loved acting so much that he continued on for decades. The actor made appearances in some modern shows such as Grey’s Anatomy and NCIS before passing away in 2014. Geer was a beloved actor, having taken over the role of the Walton family patriarch from Edgar Bergen, and played the character until his death after the completion of season 6.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2 lead actors were always mooning their co-stars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_119>The Waltons may have been a classic family drama, but that doesn’t mean that the cast didn’t enjoy some fun when the cameras weren’t rolling. So, what did they do? <a href=#>MeTV</a> reports that Waite and Geer used to moon their co-star, Learned, each and every time the chance presented itself, and they had a great time while doing it. Learned looks back on what happened, and says that her two co-stars “insisted on mooning [the cast] any chance they got.” She continued on by saying, “I saw more of their rear-ends than I ever wanted to see.” Looks like the actors insisted on entertaining each other behind the scenes and that the other co-stars look upon the memory fondly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMsJilrJ%2BjwG5%2BjKWcmpxdlrC1u9GsZLCdopp6orjWmrCsZZ2kvK%2B1zaBknKddqMGivtJnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colette-marotto-bio-age-height-boyfriend-net-worth-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Colette Marotto Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-mid-mean-on-tiktok.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What does mid mean on TikTok?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
