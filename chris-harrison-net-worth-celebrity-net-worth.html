Chris Harrison is probably best known for hosting ABC's "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" reality series. Chris hosted The Bachelor show from 2002 to 2021 and The Bachelorette from 2003 to 2021. He also hosted several spinoffs including "Bachelor in Paradise." Chris announced he was stepping down from the franchise in February 2021. His departure came after he faced criticism for defending a contestant on The Bachelorette who was accused of racism for attending an antebellum-themed fraternity formal.</p><h2 id=bachelor-salary><strong>The Bachelor Salary</strong></h2><p>At the peak of his time hosting the various incarnations of the show, Chris Harrison's salary was $4 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Christopher Bryan Harrison was born in Dallas, Texas, on July 26, 1971. He attended Lake Highlands High School, and graduated in 1989. Afterwards, he attended Oklahoma City University on a soccer scholarship, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He graduated from college with a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>Beginning in 1993, Harrison worked at CBS affiliate KWTV in Oklahoma City as a sports reporter. He got the job after he was drafted through his university's athletic association, thanks to his credentials as a college athlete on the soccer team. He stayed in this role until 1999. Then, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he briefly worked for the horse racing channel TVG Network, as well as hosted the show "Designers' Challenge" on the channel HGTV in 1999. He continued to develop his hosting career, serving as the host of the short-lived GSN game show "Mall Masters" (filmed at the Mall of America in Minnesota) in 2001.</p><h2 id=bachelor-bachelorette><strong>The Bachelor and Bachelorette</strong></h2><p>In 2002, he began hosting the romance/reality series "The Bachelor" on ABC.</p><p>The "Bachelor" franchise became a huge hit, and has aired 24 different seasons as of September 2020, all with Harrison as the host. The show has become a huge cultural phenomenon, with each season trending on social media and generating large ratings. It has also spawned several successful spin-offs, including "The Bachelorette", which began airing in 2003. Other "Bachelor" spin-offs that Harrison has hosted include "Bachelor Pad" (2010-2012), "Bachelor in Paradise" (since 2014), "Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise" (2015), "Bachelor Winter Games" (2018), and "The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart" (2020).</p><p>As we mentioned earlier in this article, Chris stepped down from the franchise in February 2021 in the wake of a racism controversy. Just before he stepped down, photos surfaced showing Bachelorette winner Rachel Kirkconnell attending an antebellum-themed fraternity party years earlier. Rachel quickly apologized and Chris attempted to defend her in an interview with the TV show "Extra." His remarks on Extra were not well received and the fury grew so loud that he ultimately decided to depart the show.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-203794 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Chris-Harrison.jpg alt="Chris Harrison net worth" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-203794 class=wp-caption-text>Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-work><strong>Other Work</strong></h2><p>In addition to his "The Bachelor" hosting duties, Chris Harrison has also served as the host of the syndicated version of the game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" from 2015 to 2019.
