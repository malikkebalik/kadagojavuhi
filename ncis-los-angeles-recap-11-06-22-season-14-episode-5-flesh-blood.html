Or in this case a “woman hunt”. They were looking for Alice Morgan. She was the wife of the late Naval Lieutenant Jeff Morgan. Morgan was brutally murdered at his home and his wife was seen fleeing from the crime scene. Now, there could be any number of reasons why she ran. She could have run because she murdered her husband. She also could have run because she was in fear for her life. The team had to find her either way and they had to investigate Morgan’s death as well. Morgan wasn’t just any naval officer. He was on a DOD task force that was working on a highly classified mission that aimed to network the entire US military. And so he could have been killed by a rival government.</p><p>Everyone was a suspect. Russia, Iran, and China were leading the queue. The team had plenty of suspects and they felt splitting up would help them get a grip on the many angles of the case. Sam took Callen to go talk to Morgan’s Commanding Officer. Commander Burns didn’t seem fazed by Morgan’s murder. He tried to tell the guys he was too busy to be wasting time by coming to the boat shed. But they insisted. He ended up meeting with them and he was still feeling a type of way. He also had no clue who killed Morgan. He was asked about Alice. Burns said she wasn’t very friendly and that she seemed standoffish.</p><p>Deeks and Roundtree went to the victim’s home. They went searching for evidence of who could have killed Morgan and all they found was that the couple lived above their means. They used the money on expensive vacations, and watches and they were basically broke. Shyra was later able to determine that Alice booked a luxury rental house literally an hour after her husband was murdered. Alice was definitely on the run. She rented a house a couple of counties away. Even if it was just her now. And Deeks and Callen went to the rental and they picked up Alice before she could run again.</p><p>Alice refused to talk to them at the time. She claimed that she talked and talked and no one was listening when it mattered. She then claimed she no longer wants to talk. Roundtree wanted to push her. He wanted to keep questioning her and Deeks came up with another tactic. Deeks noticed that Alice was favoring one side. She also did her best to cover up some bruises on her arm. Deeks noticed this and it reminded him of when he and his mother were abused. Deeks recognized the signs in Alice. He opened up to her about when he was abused as a kid. It helped her to identify with him and she realized it was safe to talk to him.</p><p>Alice admitted she was a battered wife. She reported her husband twice. Both times to the naval authority and nothing was ever done about him. She was made aware very early on that Morgan meant something to the Navy while she does not. No one believed her. No one helped her. Morgan forced her to push everyone away and so she had no one to turn to when she came home to find him dead. Alice even tried to save him. She knew that her reports against him might make her look guilty and that’s why she ran. Alice didn’t kill her husband. Her husband was up to some shady stuff. She said he would often come home late and smell of oil.</p><p>It turns out the Navy not only protected an abuser, but they also overlooked he was a possible terrorist. Morgan used his contact with the Navy to get his hands on enough C4 to create a bomb. Morgan has been using his position to get everything he could to make a terrorist-level bomb. His boss didn’t notice any of the stuff was missing until NCIS called him to tell him about it. Burns was the same guy that didn’t follow up on any of Alice’s outcries. He said he didn’t have enough evidence to pursue a case against Morgan much less bench him. And yet Morgan was secretly making a bomb behind his back that he planned on selling to Ivan Parsons.</p><p>Parsons was officially in Import/Export. He claimed on paper that he just helps people with fancy food and wine and the truth is that he has ties with many extremist groups all around the world. He was an arms dealer. He approached Morgan. Morgan was living above his means and was heavily in debt. His wife didn’t have access to any of the bank accounts. She didn’t know that her husband had three bank accounts and that Parsons was making payments to all of them. Parsons must have killed Morgan the moment he got the bombs. The team then went looking for Parsons. They found him at the warehouse for his legitimate business. And while he did set off a bomb, they were able to arrest him without anyone getting seriously hurt.</p><p>Kensi stayed home during this case because she was introducing her mother-in-law to Rosa. But Bertie being back in town helped Deeks with talking about his dad. And that man abusing them.</p><p>And Callen went home to Anna where he told her he needed to look for Hetty. He needed answers. He couldn’t move on without them or plan a wedding without them and so Callen was going to be the one person who will talk. He’s going after Hetty.</p><p>The End</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnnpi2tHnLqKpmmZ6csq2x0mapnpuRpXpyfYxpbWZqYmLApq3SqKVmaWRisrG10qibnmVlYrOtsdKhZJukn6SxcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-herjavec-of-shark-tank-remembers-his-first-big-6-million-splurge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Herjavec Of 'Shark Tank' Remembers His First Big $6 Million Splurge</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maverick-carter-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maverick Carter Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
