As a child, she began dancing ballet and continued dancing into her adolescence. She attended high school in Oakville and then studied at Appleby College following her high school graduation. While a teenager and during her early 20s, she worked as a camp counselor at Camp Totoredaca.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Braeumler initially began her career by opening a dance studio where she taught dance classes. She then began helping her husband, Bryan, develop his various business ideas. Bryan had founded a construction company, Baemler Quality Construction and Renovations. He drew the attention of HGTV Canada and was cast on a new show, "Disaster DIY," as the host. By 2011, he had launched Baeumler Approved, a website that helped homeowners find home-service companies in Canada. He also became the spokesperson of HeyBryan, a peer-to-peer mobile marketplace app that mimicked the services provided by the website. While Bryan was developing his home renovation skills, Sarah began working as an interior designer.</p><p>Over the years, Bryan landed more and more opportunities on HGTV and Sarah eventually joined him on screen. They first appeared together in "Bryan Inc" in the fall of 2016. They later appeared on the show "Renovation Island' after the couple purchased a dilapidated resort in the Bahamas in 2019.

In 2016, she created her own lifestyle subscription box called "Sarah Delivered." The box includes hand-picked items that Sarah personally enjoys. The next year, she published the first issue of a new lifestyle magazine called "Curated." In 2017, she launched her own design service company called Refined Living. While maintaining these businesses, she spent much of the following couple years working on the island renovation. After the hotel resort opened in 2020, she was free to focus on new ideas that involved expanding her lifestyle brand.</p><p>In 2021, Sarah launched her own lifestyle e-commerce website, SarahBaeumler.com. The website features past design projects that Sarah has worked on and provides potential clients with a means of booking her services. It also acts as an internet shop for some of her own products, as she began producing various candles, skincare, soaps, and interior design pieces under her own named brand.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Sarah initially met her future husband, Bryan, while in high school, though they did not begin dating at the time. They lost contact for a while before reconnecting around ten years later through a common friend. They began dating before eventually getting married in 2004. They subsequently had four children whom they named Lincoln, Quintyn, Charlotte, and Josephine. While living in the Bahamas while renovating the hotel, the children were homeschooled. The kids were later sent to various schools in the Bahamas to continue their education.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvSmqmaoF2XrqbBzKWcq2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-draper-on-splitting-california-into-6-states.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Draper on Splitting California Into 6 States</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leanne-lelee-lyons-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposa-net-worth-familia.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Leanne &amp;quot;Lelee&amp;quot; Lyons biografa, edad, altura, esposa, net worth, familia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
