But throughout all the red carpets and interviews, including the <a href=# class=T3D>2022 Met Gala</a> —&nbsp;where she’s a co-chair alongside Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and <a href=# class=T3D>Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> —&nbsp;she hasn't mentioned much in terms of a love interest. This makes fans think <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King isn’t dating anyone</a> right now, and given the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>death of her only son Ian Alexander Jr.</a> in January 2022, a relationship might be the last thing on her mind.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King opened up about her dating life</a> in a 2019 interview, explaining that her many jobs and family life prevented her from having much time for a full-blown relationship. However, she admitted that she was occasionally dating. “People say, ‘You’re not dating anyone?’” she told the New York Post. “I mean, I’m dating, but it’s very comfortable where I am right now. Disrupting that means being in an uncomfortable place, and I’m not ready for that.”</p><p>Although she has had such a prolific career, King's dating history is actually pretty succinct. She married Ian Alexander in 1997 before divorcing him in 2007. “The marriage part was probably the hardest part of it all,” King told Bustle in 2021. “And I think any married couple that's remained married, hats off to them because they were able to get over those times when you’re growing at different speeds and in different directions and finding a way to bring it back and get back on the same path. That’s difficult. My ex-husband and I found that we’re much better co-parents and friends than we are as husband and wife.” Together, they had their son, <a href=# class=T3D>Ian Jr.</a>, who had been known to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>support his mom </a>at award shows. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>He died by suicide</a> on Jan. 22 at just 26 years old.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Regina King and Ian Alexander Sr. at the 2005 Oscars.KMazur/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Although her split with Alexander was rocky, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King said</a><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>that they worked to remain friends</a> for the sake of their son. “Because of our issues, Ian was becoming the kid whose parents were so disconnected that they couldn’t even sit next to each other, let alone have a civilized conversation,” she wrote in an essay for Essence, explaining how they were able to take their first steps toward co-parenting after feeling so distant.</p><p>Four years after her divorce, King found love again with Cosby Show actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner. The pair formerly met in the 1980s when they were both sitcom stars and finally started dating in 2011, giving fans very nostalgic and sentimental feelings. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King and Warner broke up two years later</a>, reportedly leaving King feeling “brokenhearted.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=3><p>Regina King and Malcolm-Jamal Warner in 2007.Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>After her split, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King expressed that she had no desire to start dating again</a>, telling Wendy Williams in 2015 that she was just too busy with work and her girlfriends to make it a priority. However, that hasn't stopped fans from playing matchmaker for her.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jennifer Graylock - PA Images/PA Images/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Fans have been rooting for <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>King to start dating Brad Pitt</a> — or at least star in a rom-com together — after their sweet interaction at the 2020 Oscars, when she presented him with the Best Supporting Actor award for Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood. She later revealed to ExtraTV <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>what she told Pitt</a> after his big win: “Just enjoy the moment, just shine.”</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Sep. 20, 2020</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZrCgn2K2tHnRnp6ippFiuKq6xmabmqyZo7Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colorado-wildfires-map-see-where-fires-are-burning.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Colorado Wildfires Map: See Where Fires Are Burning</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./valentina-lisitsa-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Valentina Lisitsa Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
