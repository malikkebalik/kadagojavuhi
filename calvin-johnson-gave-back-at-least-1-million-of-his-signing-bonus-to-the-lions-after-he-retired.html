Over the course of his career with the Detroit Lions, Johnson amassed 731 receptions for 11,619 yards and 83 touchdowns, and it didn't seem as if he was slowing down after a 2015 season that saw him rack up 88 receptions for 1,214 yards and 9 touchdowns. But citing being "fed up" with football, Johnson decided to hang up his cleats following the 2015 season, leaving the game as one of the greatest players in Detroit Lions history. But according to a report, the Lions didn't treat him like one of their greats, forcing him to cough up a decent chunk of change after he retired from football.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, the Lions forced Megatron to pay back a portion of his signing bonus when he retired, an amount that totaled at least $1 million. It was originally believed that Johnson paid the Lions back $320,000. According to records from the NFL Players Association, Johnson paid $320,000, or roughly 10 percent of the $3.2 million signing bonus proration that the Lions were entitled to according to the NFL's collective bargaining agreement.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This revelation may be one of the reasons why Johnson hasn't had many nice things to say about the Lions post-retirement.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-225797 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GettyImages-459655148.jpg alt width=900 height=595 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-225797 class=wp-caption-text>(Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>"I don't even like to talk Lions too much just because the way our relationship ended… If they see me around here, we'll see.
