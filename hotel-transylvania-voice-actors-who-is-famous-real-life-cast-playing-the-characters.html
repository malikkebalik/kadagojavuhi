His voice added authenticity to the character. Adam is a famous Hollywood actor who has done many films like “Just Go With It”, “Grown Ups” and more. Before becoming a mainstream actor, he was a comedian in “Saturday Night Live”.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When <a href=# rel=noopener>Hotel Transylvania</a> voice actors introduced Adam, everyone knew that the film is going to be epic. And it so happened. Adam was Count Dracula who is the </span><i><span>“conflicted patriarch and perennial hotel proprietor”</span></i><span>. It was hard for him to see his little girl grow up and explore the world. As time passed, he realized that it is time for him to let go of her and nurture her true self.</span></p><p><strong>However, for “Hotel Transylvania: Transformation”, YouTuber and impressionist Brian Hull replaced Adam.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Andy Samberg as Jonathan “Johnny” Loughran</h3><p><span>The only human who brought out the true nature of the people of “Hotel Transylvania”, Johnny is the ostracized human belonging to the Dracula family. Andy Samberg joins the “Hotel Transylvania” voice actors after his popularity with SNL and “<a href=# rel=noopener>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>”. He even voiced in the animated film “Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs”.</span></p><p><span>In “Hotel Transylvania”, he successfully manages to break the old law and orders set by Dracula count. Moreover, he ends up becoming Dracula’s son-in-law after marrying Marvis.&nbsp; Johnny is a goofy and loving human being who loves his Dracula family very much.</span></p><h3>Selena Gomez as Mavis Dracula</h3><p><span>Famous singer, actress, and producer <a href=# rel=noopener>Selena Gomez</a> became a part of “Hotel Transylvania” voice actors with her role as Count Dracula’s daughter Mavis.

Selena is a pop icon and her presence in the film adds to her acting career along with “The Dead Don’t Die” and “A Rainy Day in New York”.</span></p><h3>David Spade as Griffin</h3><p><span>Another Saturday Night Live comedian who got major success in the 1990s, David has been the king in this segment for years. “Tommy Boy”, “Grown Ups”, “Black Sheep”, “The Wrong Missy” and “The Do-Over” are some of the biggest hits in his career. Well, he became a “Hotel Transylvania” voice actor with his role of the invisible man Griffin is inspired by H.G. Wells’ 189 sci-fi novels.</span></p><h3>Keegan-Michael Key as Murry</h3><p><span>Murray the mummy is as funny as you can think. Keegan is already a famed comedian and had recently done films like “<a href=# rel=noopener>Toy Story 4</a>” and “The Lion King” live-action. But being Murray makes this “Hotel Transylvania” voice actor an indispensable inclusion of the franchise.</span></p><h3>Brad Abrell as Frankenstein</h3><p><span>He may look monstrous but Frankenstein has the kindest heart of them all. Frankenstein is cumbersome and Brad Abrell clearly brings out that trait of the character. Abrell’s previous vocal credits are in the “Men in Black” franchise and after being on the list of “Hotel Transylvania” voice actors, he has achieved much more.</span></p><h3>Steve Buscemi as Wayne</h3><p><span>Buscemi is famous for impersonating for over 40 years now. From the “Monsters Inc.” franchise to “The Boss Baby”, he is pretty iconic in this field. Plus, the “Hotel Transylvania” voice actor for werewolf Wayne needed to be someone unmatched. He is just notorious and constantly struggles to manage his kids.</span></p><p><span>Other “Hotel Transylvania” voice actors were eventually added for supporting roles like Asher Blinkoff as Deniss, Kathryn Hahn as Ericka Van Helsing, Jim Gaffigan as Abraham Van Helsing, Molly Shanon as Wanda, Fran Drescher as Eunice, Sadie Sandler as Winnie and more. Only the most important “Hotel Transylvania” voice actors who have been seen throughout the franchise are noted above.
