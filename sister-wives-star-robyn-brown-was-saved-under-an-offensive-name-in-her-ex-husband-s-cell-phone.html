Kody isn’t Robyn’s first legal husband, though. Before marrying into the Brown family, Robyn was married to a man named <a href=#>David Preston Jessop</a>.</p><p id=par-2_27>While Robyn hasn’t spoken much about her ex-husband, their divorce was a contentious one. Her ex-husband, Jessop, listed Robyn as a foul name in his cell phone.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-david-jessop-robyn-brown-s-ex-husband-had-her-saved-as-reality-bitch-in-his-phone>David Jessop, Robyn Brown’s ex-husband, had her saved as ‘Reality Bitch’ in his phone&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_63>While there is some conflicting information about Robyn Brown and David Jessop’s divorce, one thing seems certain. The former spouses certainly don’t get along following the end of their marriage. The reason for the split is listed as an irreconcilable difference, but Robyn Brown has eluded to abuse inside the home on social media. David Jessop has never spoken about the split publicly.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/robyn-brown-crying.jpg><p id=par-4_42>Court documents show that Jessop was the party who initiated the divorce. Still, it is unclear exactly when or why the couple separated. According to additional documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch Weekly</a>, the former couple tried to work out a parenting agreement.</p><p id=par-5_35>Attempts to create parenting time for Jessop failed. In the parenting agreement documents, it is revealed that Jessop had Robyn’s contact information saved as “Reality Bitch” in his cell phone instead of by her name.</p><h2>Kody Brown adopted the three children Robyn shared with David Jessop&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_46>Robyn and Jessop ended their marriage about a year before Robyn met Kody Brown. Eventually, Kody legally <a href=#>divorced his first wife</a>, Meri Brown, to marry Robyn. The family initially claimed that the “legal restructuring” of the family was to benefit Robyn’s three children with David Jessop.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_35>While&nbsp;Sister Wives&nbsp;fans don’t believe that Kody’s decision to “legally restructure” his plural family was only about the kids, Kody did go on to adopt Dayton, Brianna, and Aurora, Robyn’s children from her previous marriage.</p><p id=par-8_67>Kody has remained active in their lives. He has opted to step back from the lives of his children with his three former wives. In fact, it appears that Kody is <a href=#>estranged from most of his children </a>with Janelle Brown. He never speaks about his only child with Meri Brown and appears to have a strained relationship with some of the kids he shares with Christine Brown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_68>Robyn’s ex-husband appears to have gone on to remarry and have a family, although he doesn’t share his life on social media. Jessop became known to the public when a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe </a>page was started to help with his medical expenses. According to the fundraiser’s creator, Jessop was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia after a routine eye exam. He is currently receiving treatment, according to the fundraiser’s latest update.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR50q2Yq2WipK%2B6uoybqaivnmK8p7LEp6qirpViu6K5xGacsWWYqsCjrc2dZJydnKF6sbTOp5xnoKSiuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dont-a-hightower-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dont'a Hightower Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-bungo-stray-dogs-return-for-season-6.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Bungo Stray Dogs return for season 6?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
