While medical dramas have been a staple on network television for several decades, few balanced comedy with the drama&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href=#>Scrubs</a>&nbsp;did.&nbsp;It was a meticulously researched comedy that still packed the punch of a drama like&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy. However, one mistake lasted over <a href=#>five seasons</a> and drove Elizabeth Banks crazy until she joined the cast and was able to fix it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is&nbsp;‘Scrubs’?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_45>Scrubs&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>debuted on NBC in 2001</a>. While many medical shows offered gritty, somewhat realistic depictions of the hospital, they often swayed toward melodrama and ignored the lighthearted part of things. Balancing this lightness with some dark subject matter,&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;offered fans of the medical genre something somewhat different.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_32>The biggest sell of&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;might have been its cast. While most of the cast was unknown or synonymous with smaller roles at the time, it made several of its members bigger stars.</p><p id=par-4_47>Zach Braff, who played JD Dorian, has since become a successful film actor and director. Donald Faison, who many fans&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>may have known from&nbsp;Clueless</a>, became a household name with more star power. From Sarah Chalke to John C. McGinley,&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;made several actors big-name stars regardless of their past experiences.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/zach-braff.jpg><p id=par-5_40>While the show was an unabashed comedy, that doesn’t mean it&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ignored more realistic aspects&nbsp;</a>of its premise. The show employed several medical advisors to ensure that no matter what happened on the screen, it was based on somewhat realistic premises.</p><p id=par-6_27>Fans adored it. For most of its nine-year run, the final two on ABC as cast members began to jump ship, the show was a massive hit.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_23>Several notable guest stars came and went throughout its run, but Elizabeth Banks did something extra notable when she donned the titular garb.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth Banks joined the show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-Banks.jpg><p id=par-8_42>As the show got more popular, its guest stars began to get bigger, too. In season five, Elizabeth Banks, who was already making her name on the big screen, joined the cast in the&nbsp;recurring role of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dr. Kim Briggs</a>, a urologist.</p><p id=par-9_38>A divorced doctor, Kim was revealed to be a longtime employee of St. Vincent’s hospital. However, JD had a switch inside his brain that meant he never saw married women. After the divorce, however, he began to notice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_38>Before long, JD and Kim were in a relationship, and before long, Kim was pregnant. JD and Kim tried to make it work but eventually went their separate ways. However, with a kid, the two remained cordial.</p><p id=par-11_38>While all of this was major, however, Banks’ greatest contribution to the show may have been fixing an error that drove her crazy for years before she finally joined the cast and had the power to fix it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flipping things around&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_31>During the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>opening credits of the show</a>, fans could see an x-ray sign in the background. However, if they paid close attention to it, they realized that the sign was backward.</p><p id=par-13_51>Perhaps, owing to her cinematic eye for detail, Banks noticed this when she was merely a fan of the hit comedy. However, when Kim was introduced to the audience, one of the first things she did was flip the errant sign and tell them it had been bugging her for years.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_41>It was a meta-joke that echoed Banks’ real-life concerns. It also was a great introduction to the character. Regardless, sometimes fans of the show, be they megastars or extras, become so entrenched with them that they notice these small things.</p><p id=par-15_30>Who knows what mistakes have still gone unnoticed, but lucky for the creators of&nbsp;Scrubs,&nbsp;Banks caught the errant sign, and they found a way to incorporate the gaffe into her character.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTApL7Um6pmrJiaeq610q2YpJ1dqbWiwIylmKyslZl6dnnSnpisp56oeqK6w2abq6emmnqmuMizmJudpJ16o63NpKpmr5mhsW%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-suicide-squad-movies-in-order.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All Suicide Squad movies in order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./she-loves-to-see-them-being-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>She Loves to See Them Being Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
