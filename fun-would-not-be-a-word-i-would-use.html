She has been <a href=#>playing the character since the TV show premiered</a> in 2007. Throughout Heartland season 10, Amy is pregnant with her daughter, Lyndy (Ruby and Emmanuella Spencer). In an interview with the Hallmarkies Podcast, Marshall discussed what it was like playing a pregnant woman.</p><h2 id=h-amber-marshall-did-not-think-amy-being-pregnant-was-fun-on-heartland>Amber Marshall did not think Amy being pregnant was ‘fun’ on ‘Heartland’</h2><p id=par-2_40>Amy reveals to her husband Ty Borden (Graham Wardle) that she is pregnant at the end of the show’s ninth season. Most of season 10 of Heartland shows Amy pregnant, and she gives birth to Lyndy in the season finale.</p><p id=par-3_11>On the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hallmarkies Podcast</a>,&nbsp;Marshall was asked about the pregnancy storyline on Heartland.</p><p id=par-4_30>“I wouldn’t say fun because it was very hot. And I wore a very thick prosthetic, like silicone suit. Fun would not be a word I would use,” Marshall admitted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_26>It’s no secret that Marshall is a lot like Amy. Like her character, Marshall loves animals and horses, and she lives on her own farm.</p><p id=par-6_22>However, because Marshall has not experienced being pregnant in real life, playing Amy’s pregnancy storyline proved to be a new challenge.</p><p id=par-7_69>“It was really great because it was one of those things where I had to play morning sickness and stuff that I’d never experienced. So it was things that I would, I’d talk to Michelle (Morgan) or I would talk to different people and be like, ‘So like, what does this mean? What is a Braxton Hicks contraction?’ All of these different things,” Marshall said on the Hallmarkies Podcast.</p><p id=par-8_28>She continued, “‘Cause on the show, I usually am pretty trained at any of the horse stories and things that I have, I’ve sort of done them before?'”</p><p id=par-9_19>On the podcast, Marshall compared Amy’s pregnancy storyline to the time in season 7 when Amy was temporarily blind.</p><p id=par-10_45>“Things like playing blind, or doing things that are totally outside of my comfort zone are like ‘OK, so now I have to go and talk with people that have these experiences so that I can make it as real as I can,'” Marshall said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-who-plays-amy-fleming-s-daughter-on-heartland>Who plays Amy Fleming’s daughter on ‘Heartland’?</h2><p id=par-11_46>On&nbsp;Heartland, Amy lives on her family’s ranch Heartland Ranch with Lyndy and her extended family. Wardle played Amy’s husband Ty until he&nbsp;<a href=#>decided to leave the show</a>. After Wardle departed from the role, Ty died from complications of a gunshot wound at the start of season 14.</p><p id=par-12_19>On the Hallmarkies Podcast, Marshall praised twin sisters Ruby Spencer and Emmanuella Spencer for their portrayal of Lyndy.</p><p id=par-13_43>“We are so lucky to have those girls… It’s a strange thing because they were cast in that role when they were like five months old,” said Marshall. “Every time I’m in a scene with either one of them I’m just blown away.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1pq3RraOappSoeqK5wZ6pZqWRp8CprculZKmkka62r7OMqamen56Wu7V5xa6lZq%2Bfqrmlec2oq2aalWLEsL7DZqBmr5%2BquaV51KycZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abbi-jacobson-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abbi Jacobson Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-altman-wiki-bio-age-career-height-family-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Altman: Wiki, Bio, Age, Career, Height, Family, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
