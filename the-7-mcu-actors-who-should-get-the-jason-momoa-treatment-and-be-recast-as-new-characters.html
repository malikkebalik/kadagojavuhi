Characters may be recast, actors may lose iconic roles, but some may just change roles. Such is the ongoing rumor about <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a></strong>. The actor, who was previously known for his roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stargate: Atlantis</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of Thrones</a>, joined the DCU as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aquaman</a> in 2018, and the King of the Sea’s stock skyrocketed. What was once mocked for being a ridiculous character compared to the likes of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, Aquaman was finally respected.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=566 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>While <a href=#>James Gunn’s</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">changes to the DCU</a> haven’t been everyone’s cup of tea, the rumors that the role of Aquaman will be recast with a younger actor leaves fans buzzing about the rumors that Gunn has other plans for Momoa to play none other than the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">intergalactic alien, Lobo</a>. Momoa certainly looks the part as the best bounty hunter in the universe. He wouldn’t be the first to portray the character; Emmett Scanlan brought him to life for the short-lived <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Krypton</a> TV series. Having Momoa play the role on the silver screen would take things to a new level.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Over at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a lot of big-name actors have surprisingly had small roles in the MCU. In some cases, they were so despised for certain scenes that fans don’t even enjoy the character anymore. Here are some MCU actors who should get the rumored Jason Momoa treatment and be offered new roles.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Christian Bale</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Christian-Bale-1.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Oscar winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christian Bale</a> is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood who can play both series and comedic roles. While his time in DC’s Dark Knight trilogy will go down in history as one of the greatest movie trilogy’s of all time, once Marvel got him under contract, they wasted his talent.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Despite the flaws in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: Love and Thunder,</a> Bale was excellent as Gorr the God Butcher. His scenes were easily the best parts of the movie, showcasing Bale’s acting talents as the sympathetic villain who lost everything, including his faith in the many deities floating around in the universe. The character of Gorr felt like it should have been a drawn-out story over several movies, but director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taika Waititi</a> wasted the award winner on much less than he deserved.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Bale could easily make his return to the MCU as a different character. The Welsh actor would be a great choice to play Mr. Fantastic, the Silver Surfer, or even Captain Britain.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Rebecca Hall</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rebecca-Hall.jpg><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>The talented actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebecca Hall</a> starred as Dr. Maya Hansen in 2013’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man 3</a>, the scientist and inventor of Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment for crippling injuries. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hall was originally promised a bigger role</a> as the film’s main villain. Unfortunately, the powers-that-be decided a female villain’s toys would not sell. After director Shane Black revealed the truth, the actress also spoke out about the ordeal, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Toronto Sun</a>:</p><p>“Halfway through shooting, they were basically like, ‘What would you think if you just got shot out of nowhere?’ I was meant to be in the movie until the end. […] I grappled with them for awhile, and then I said, ‘Well, you have to give me a decent death scene, and you have to give me one more scene with Iron Man,’ which Robert Downey, Jr. supported me on.” &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>If Marvel were to cast Bale as Mr. Fantastic in the upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> movie, it would be great to see Hall reunite on screen again with him, who played Hall’s husband in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Prestige</a>. Of course, it would also be great to see her sink her teeth into a villainous role. We’re thinking, with the darker side of the MCU coming out—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blade</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost Rider,</a> etc.—she could play the villainous Moonstone, Morgan Le Fay, or even Lady Death herself.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Evan Peters</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Evan-Peters.jpg><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>Widely known for playing Quicksilver in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men</a> franchise, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan Peters</a> made his MCU debut in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WandaVision</a>, starring as—wait for it—Pietro Maximoff, aka Quicksilver. Yes, they went there, and the fans loved it. Of course, it all turned out to be a ruse by Agatha Harkness, and Pietro turned out to be an actor named Ralph Bohner that Agatha hired to pull the wool over Wanda’s eyes.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Peters is a talented actor who recently won a Golden Globe award for his role as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.</a> His chilling portrayal of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous murderer</a> didn’t sit well with some people, but it proves he has the acting chops to pull off just about anything.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Peters’ version of Quicksilver is beloved by fans, so him putting on his racing shoes once again when the X-Men completely transition to the MCU would be fantastic. Stepping up his villainous side, he could finally bring Mephisto to live in live action, a character fans have been anxiously awaiting. That is if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> doesn’t work out.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Andy Serkis</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Andy-Serkis.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andy Serkis</a> is one of those actors who completely owns his role and can become anyone. He famously portrayed Gollum in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a> movies, Caesar in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Planet of the Apes</a> films, and even Supreme Leader Snoke in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a> movies, but in the MCU, he’s known as Ulysses Klaue. The black-market arms dealer who was working with N’Jobu and later Killmonger in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther</a> was killed off way too suddenly for such a talented actor.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>There’s one iconic role that is sure to be coming in the MCU that only an icon like Serkis could portray—Galactus. Known as the Devourer of Worlds, Galactus is a cosmic entity who consumes worlds to keep himself alive. It’s definitely a role that an actor as talented as Serkis could pull off.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sterling-K-Brown.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Blink and you would have missed the talented <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sterling K. Brown</a>’s debut in the MCU as Wakandan Prince N’Jobu at the beginning of Black Panther. The actor, who has won four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Emmy awards, and a Golden Globe, is way too talented to have a mere five-minute scene. Brown, known for his compelling role as one of the Big Three in This Is Us, was killed off before fans even fully realized what was going on.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Brown could really sink his teeth into roles like Professor Xavier or even Magneto in the upcoming X-Men movie. He could also provide a fresh spin on the role of Doctor Doom in Fantastic Four.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Christopher Eccleston</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Christopher-Eccleston.jpg><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Eccleston</a> portrayed Malekith, the leader of the Dark Elves, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: The Dark World</a>. The talented British actor, known for his role as the titular character in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Who</a>, definitely needs a bigger role than a villain nobody remembers.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Like Sterling K. Brown, Eccleston would be perfect in the role of Magneto, Professor Xavier, or even Doctor Doom. Having already played the world’s most famous doctor, setting his sights on the MCU’s most famous doctor would be perfect.</p><h2 id=h-chris-pratt data-injectable=false><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chris-Pratt.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, is such a goofy, lovable oaf of a character who knows how to work hard and play hard. After Thanos killed Gamora during the events of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avengers: Infinity War</a>, Star-Lord’s anger got the best of him, allowing Thanos to escape to Earth and perform the snap. While the whole thing isn’t just his fault, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he gets the brunt of the blame</a>, causing some fans to even want the character out of the MCU.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=false>What can we say? You either love him or you love to hate him. Either way, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Pratt</a> clearly portrays his character well. With such a well-known character, it would be difficult for the actor to change roles, but there are ways. With Kang the Conqueror set to shake things up on the horizon, Star-Lord could be wiped from existence. That doesn’t mean Pratt needs to leave the MCU, however. In an alternate timeline, Pratt could portray Ego, Peter Quill’s biological father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJytXZawtbvRrGSwoJ9iwKm71KWbZp%2BVqXq1tMRmoZqrn6N6rrvMqJhmrKKarrW5xKerZpmemXqjsYyrnJyZo6l6or%2BMmmSnnadisKmt0ZqarZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./travelers-can-swim-through-caves-in-the-dominican-republic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Travelers Can Swim Through Caves in the Dominican Republic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./post-malone-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Post Malone Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
