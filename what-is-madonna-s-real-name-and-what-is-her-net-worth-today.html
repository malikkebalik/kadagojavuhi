She was born Madonna Louise Ciccone on Aug. 16, 1958, in Bay City, Michigan to a mother of French Canadian descent and a father with Italian&nbsp;immigrant parents. Madonna was named after her mom who passed away from breast cancer when she was just 5 years old.</p><p id=par-4_31>Over the years, the “Ray of Light” songstress talked about how the loss of her mother at such a young age affected and shaped her when she was a teen.</p><p id=par-5_33>“I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was by not having a mother,” she previously said in an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="interview with the Los Angeles Times (opens in a new tab)" href=#>interview with the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p id=par-6_53>Adding, “I did not have a female role model. Women are traditionally raised to be subservient, passive, accepting. The man is supposed to be the pioneer. He makes the money, he makes the rules. For example, mothers teach you manners. And I absolutely did not learn any of those rules and regulations.”</p><h2>Her net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Madonna-2.jpg><p id=par-7_47>Madonna is not only a pop music icon, who paved the way for so many female stars today, she’s also an actress, a songwriter, a producer, and an author.

Hasn’t he had enough success? Hasn’t he made enough money? Hasn’t he made a name for himself? Did somebody go to Pablo Picasso and say, “Okay, you’re 80 years old. Haven’t you painted enough paintings?” No… I’ll stop doing everything that I do when I don’t want to do it anymore.</p><h2>The singer is now being sued by one of her own fans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_29>While Madonna is still doing what she loves, she’s not getting a ton of love from her fans because of her recent behavior on her Madame X tour.</p><p id=par-11_44>On Nov. 5, 2019,&nbsp;Madge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rubbed her fans the wrong way (opens in a new tab)" href=#>rubbed her fans the wrong way</a> when she showed up a few hours late for her 10:30 p.m. show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
