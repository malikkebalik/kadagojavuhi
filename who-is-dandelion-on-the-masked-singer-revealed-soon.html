Both cover their face with Doll and when the Dolls return and Deadelion is crowned as the winner of the WB Movie Night.</span></p><p><span>Do you interested to know who is Deadline on The Masked Singer? Let’s have a look at the clues given during the show to reveal the hidden personality under Dandelion custom.</span></p><h2><b>Do you Know Who Dandelion is on The Masked Singer?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Clue by Billboards. “These heels were made for performing. TV, movies, concerts and even charting next to Olivia Rodrigo.”</span></p><p><span>A Voiceover clue is given by the singer, “My life has always felt kind of like a movie. The Wizard of Oz, to be exact. Like Judy Garland, I started my career when I was just a kid. I’ve worked with all the greats: Madonna, Flea, Sir Elton John. The living and the dead. But the way I am, I was restless for a home.</span></p><p><span>A place to play my keys. So, I put down roots, in a musical city. Sadly, much like the Wizard of Oz, a devastating twister hit my home. But just like dandelions growing through the cracks in the concrete, I rebuilt. I learned no matter what, there’s always sunshine after the rain. Which is why I’m so excited to sing this song tonight.”(<a href=# rel=noopener>according to What to Watch)</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Masked-Singer-1.webp><p><span>But with these clues, it is not an easy job to reveal the personality. Sometimes you can receive clues from the singer’s outfit also, but every time it does not help you. Dandelion chooses a green body suit with a tulle skirt, and with this, she is looking like a flower stem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But her crown is the center of attraction. In her mask white fluff, which gives her a complete Dandelion look.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Guesses For The Masked Singer Customized as Dandelion?&nbsp;</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Masked-Singer.webp><p><span>There were several guesses as to reveal Dandelion like Zooey Deschanel, Emmy Rossum and Reese Witherspoon. Diana Ross is one of the guesses because Ross is famous for her beautiful hair. When the show’s clip dropped on youtube, in the comment section people start again guessing, Ryder True commented that&nbsp; “Annie Lennox I know that voice I listen to her on the radio so many times.”</span></p><p><strong>Check out to get previous information about The Masked Singer:</strong></p><p><span>One more fan, Kae, wrote, “Dandelion sounds a bit like Annie Lennox?” Despite Annie other guesses were like Kelis, Alanis Morissette, Dua Lipa, and Mary J. Blige. Thought Dandelion identity was not opened yet. But she would be a superb singer who debuts with Matis and Doll.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Floating around the rainbow thanks to this performance from <a href=# rel=noopener>#DandelionMask</a>. 😍🌈<a href=# rel=noopener>#TheMaskedSinger</a> is back for <a href=# rel=noopener>#MovieNight</a> TONIGHT at 8/7c on <a href=# rel=noopener>@FOXTV</a>. 🥳 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jQaziL2Z0b</a></p><p>— The Masked Singer (@MaskedSingerFOX) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 5, 2023</a></p><p><span>“I think the bell might be used in this episode in the scene where Ken is looking left and red lights are flashing,” a fan wrote.</span></p><p><span>“Doll definitely leaves this episode solely off performance order as we see in their lineup of Doll > Dandelion > Mantis,” another fan wrote. “I think Doll drops first, then I think whoever doesn’t stay gets the bell. It’s possible Mantis advances and Dandelion gets the bell because I think she and Mantis will both be at least good.”</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Who do you think <a href=# rel=noopener>#DandelionMask</a> is? 👀</p><p>Drop those early guesses in the replies and tune in tonight to check out their clue package! 👏 <a href=# rel=noopener>#TheMaskedSinger</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YGyLLZICbp</a></p><p>— The Masked Singer (@MaskedSingerFOX) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 5, 2023</a></p><p><span>So, you can read all the clues and try to identify the Dandelion as soon as you can.
