I kind of learned about how flexible I was and how much I can take and learned a lot about myself. I learned about wouldn’t stand for what I wouldn’t take.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lamar-odom-shared-if-sabrina-parr-will-appear-in-the-second-memoir>Lamar Odom shared if Sabrina Parr will appear in the second memoir&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_65>Since ending his engagement, Odom remains focused on his work-related projects.
