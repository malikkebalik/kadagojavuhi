Post Malone has a net worth of $45 million. Post Malone rose to fame following his debut single, "White Iverson," in 2015, which was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><p>His unique blend of hip-hop, rock, and pop music captured a wide audience, leading to the success of his debut studio album, "Stoney," in 2016. This album was certified multi-platinum, yielding the quadruple-platinum hit single "Congratulations." He continued to innovate with his second album, "Beerbongs & Bentleys" in 2018, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and broke several streaming records. This album included hit singles like "Rockstar" and "Psycho," both of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. Malone achieved further success with his third album, "Hollywood's Bleeding," in 2019, which also debuted at No. 1 and included the chart-topping single "Circles."</p><p>Throughout his career, Post Malone has garnered numerous awards, including multiple Billboard Music Awards and American Music Awards, highlighting his significant influence and success in the music industry. His ability to cross genres and maintain relevance is a testament to his unique talent and the profound impact he has made on popular music.</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. Raised by his father and stepmother, the family relocated to Grapevine, Texas, following his father's appointment as the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. His father introduced him to multiples genres of music, having been a DJ in his youth. It was in Texas that Post began to play the guitar, and was in a heavy metal band.According to Post, he chose the stage name "Post Malone" when he was around 14 or 15, using his last name plus "Malone", which he got from an online rap name generator. He created his first mixtape "Young and After Them Riches" at the age of 16. After graduating, he briefly enrolled in Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas, but dropped out and moved to Los Angeles with friend Jason Probst.</p><p>In LA, Post, Probst and several other producers and artists formed the group BLCKVRD and recorded music together, while several members also lived together in the San Fernando Valley. It was there that Post met Rex Kudo, who produced several tracks for him including "White Iverson". In February 2015, "White Iverson" was uploaded onto Post's account on SoundCloud, a music sharing platform, and the accompanying music video was released on July 2015.</p><h2 id=achieving-success><strong>Achieving Success</strong></h2><p>"White Iverson" was praised by many, including <a href=# title="Mac Miller Net Worth">Mac Miller</a> and <a href=# title="Wiz Khalifa Net Worth">Wiz Khalifa</a>, and hit one million views within a month of its release.

As for concert revenue, Post grosses $500,000 per concert. He also hosts his own music festival, Posty Fest, which began in 2018 and sold out before the lineup was even announced. Additionally, Post enjoys sponsorships with brands such as HyperX, True Religion and Bud Light. His Bud Light partnership has been particularly extensive; Post has not only performed at various Bud Light events such as their Bud Light: Dive Bar concerts, together they have also released a limited-time fashion collection that went on sale in August 2019.</p><h2 id=earnings><strong>Earnings</strong></h2><p>Between June 2019 and June 2020 Post Malone earned $60 million from his various endeavors.

He has also earned millions from endorsements with companies like Bud Light Seltzer which included a memorable Super Bowl ad.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-239681 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Post-Malone2.jpg alt="Post Malone" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-239681 class=wp-caption-text>Joe Scarnici/Getty Images</p><h2 id=maison-no-9><strong>Maison No. 9</strong></h2><p>In June 2020 Post released a line of rosé, Maison No. 9. The line sold 50,000 units in just 48 hours. Unlike a lot of celebrities in the liquor business, Malone has been hands-on with this project from the beginning. He designed the distinctive glass topper found in every bottle, he collaborated with winemaker Alexis Cornu on the rosé's blend, and he even came up with the name: a reference, he says, to a tarot card deck's nine of swords, a symbol for anxiety. Maison No. 9, in turn, becomes a tribute to the way Malone has found wine an invaluable tonic for his own personal anxieties:</p><p><strong>"As soon as I got old enough, I tried wine and I was like, This is helpful to me; it tastes good and it makes me feel happy."</strong></p><p>Malone also spoke on his straightforward ambitions in the wine business:</p><p><strong>"I've loved wine for a minute now. And Dre [London] and I were talking and we said, Why not make our own deal and see how it goes? We flew to Provence [France] and picked the grapes and made the blend and everything. And I said, This is something that I really, really like. I'm so blessed and happy that we're crushing it the way that we are. We're trying to make an empire so that we can drink for free and our kids can eat forever."</strong></p><p>Fans of Post Malone might have gotten a look at Maison No. 9 before anyone else. Three weeks before the launch of the rosé, Malone performed a livestreamed, 80-minute set of Nirvana covers to raise money for the UN Foundation's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization. In the background behind Malone, bottles of Maison No. 9 were visible to attentive viewers, and like the subsequent launch the concert was a huge success, raising some $1 million for the fund.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-304651 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-522283336.jpg alt width=900 height=690 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-304651 class=wp-caption-text>Randy Shropshire/Getty Images</p><h2 id=envy-gaming><strong>Envy Gaming</strong></h2><p>In August 2020, he invested in Envy Gaming and became a co-owner. In April 2023, Malone designed the exterior of a Raising Canes restaurant in Midvale, Utah.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303609 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Post-Malone.jpg alt width=900 height=644 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303609 class=wp-caption-text>Paul Morigi/Getty Images</p><h2 id=personal-life-controversies><strong>Personal Life and Controversies</strong></h2><p>Post was in a three-year relationship with Ashlen Diaz which ended in November 2018. In June 2022, Malone revealed he is engaged and that they have a daughter together.</p><p>He currently lives in Los Angeles, California, although he maintains another $3 million 13,000-square-foot home in northern Utah. His previous home in San Fernando Valley, California, was robbed on September 1, 2018.</p><p>He is well-known for his bold personal style, which includes a large collection of face tattoos. In particular, he has a number of face tattoos, such as a line of barbed wire across his forehead, the words "Stay Away" above his right eyebrow, "always" and "tired" under both eyes, and "STONEY" below his chin.</p><p>One controversy surrounding Post is the accusations by multiple publications and on social media of being a "culture vulture". These accuse him of "appropriating" African-American culture. In January 2018, Post went on an intoxicated rant against people who accuse him of such. Several days later, he said in an interview with GQ "there's a struggle being a white rapper." He also received backlash for comments he made in an interview with Polish media outlet NewOnce, claiming that modern hip-hop lacks "people talking about real shit," and that "if you're looking to think about life, don't listen to hip-hop." Critics included fellow rappers Lil B and <a href=# title="Vince Staples Net Worth">Vince Staples</a>, as well as criticism across social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6W8tMCMppilp56aeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-7-mcu-actors-who-should-get-the-jason-momoa-treatment-and-be-recast-as-new-characters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 7 MCU actors who should get the Jason Momoa treatment and be recast as new characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-opting-out-this-offseason-will-make-kevin-durant-a-lot-more-money-for-years-to-come.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Opting Out This Offseason Will Make Kevin Durant A Lot More Money For Years To Come</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
