He really thought it was him that was going to go. He says he has nine lives. Meanwhile, France is heartbroken that Matt is gone and feels like she has been marooned with nothing again. Brandon voted Matt out to break up the showmance.</p><p>Heidi knew she had her advantage and she used it the best way to make as few enemies as possible. Yam Yam loves that the game is changing, now he is in the middle with Carolyn and everyone wants their votes. Carson thinks the other tribes are underestimating the former Tika members. Matt’s slogan when he came out here was “not to get cocky kid” and he plans on sticking to that.</p><p>The next day, there is tree mail, “today there’s only one necklace, only one truly safe when you’re through. Such gruelling competition, it will be run two by two. You must divide into five pairs to compete.” Carson is sick, nobody wants to pair with him so Carolyn volunteers. Lauren is worried, her energy is low and she doesn’t think anyone will pair with her but Danny does.</p><p>Time for the immunity challenge. Carson tells Jeff that he has been throwing up, about eight times and he has no idea where it came from. The pairs are Kane & Brandon, Frannie & Yam Yam, Carolyn & Carson, Danny & Lauren, Heidi & Jaime. Today’s challenge is going to run quickly, it is going to run in stages. Players will be eliminated in each stage. In order to make the next stage you have to make the cut. First stage, they are going to crawl one person at a time through a muddy twisted net, dig up planks and race back to their mat.</p><p>The four pairs to get back to their mat and plant their flag moves on. He next stage they will race up a cargo net and use the planks to cross a roped bridge. They need to get both players and all three planks to the other side, slide down a wall and race to their mat. The first two pairs to finish move on. The final stage, pairs are gone, they are now individuals. They will use their arms to brace against two walls while their feet are perched on narrow foot poles.</p><p>Carolyn is stuck in the net, she is having a hard time, but she manages to get out, she doesn’t give out and Carson is right behind. Unfortunately, they don’t make it to the next stage, they have no shot at immunity.</p><p>Danny, Lauren, Kane and Brandon make it to the final stage that is all about pain tolerance.</p><p>Kane is out first, then Brandon. It is down to Danny and Lauren. Danny drops, Lauren wins immunity.</p><p>All of the tribe is in the water, they are trying to wash off the mud. Yam Yam is worried that he is going to be put up again, but Frannie’s name is also being thrown around. Everyone seems to be leaning towards Frannie, they find she is a strong player. Heidi might consider it, but she thinks this is the time to make a big move and Frannie is not it. Heidi is pitching to get rid of Brandon because he is strong, she goes to Yam Yam and Carolyn to try and get their votes. Yam Yam checks with Carson, Heidi walks up and says that Danny has an idol and is going to play it for Frannie, so if they vote out Brandon it is a no fail.</p><p>Time for Tribal Council and now there is a jury. Heidi says that everyone is vulnerable except for Lauren. Yam Yam says the key is to know what is going on behind the scenes. Heidi says the adrenaline was 10 out of 10 today. Brandon says you can have a million conversations but you don’t know what your fate is until it happens. Lauren feels like tonight might be a majority vote. Kane says he moves with intention and he has intention with his vote tonight. Time to vote.</p><p>All the votes are in, Danny gets up and gives Jeff an immunity idol and says he wants to play it for Frannie. First vote is for Fannie, then Frannie, Frannie, Frannie, Frannie, Frannie, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon. That is it for Brandon, he is voted out and they pulled off a big blindside tonight.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxno6q%2Ft7XVqKlmqpWYrrF5j21kanFdZ4Buv8SaqqimXWmBbrHPoqqonJVihW6wzqerZp%2BVqXqku8KksGajmZl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zsa-zsa-gabor-s-widower-must-leave-their-15-million-mansion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zsa Zsa Gabor's Widower Must Leave Their $15 Million Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kerry-king-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kerry King Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
