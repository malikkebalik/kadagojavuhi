He directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955–1965). Hitchcock began his career in the British film industry as a title designer and art director for a number of silent films during the early 1920s. He made his directorial debut with the 1925 release The Pleasure Garden. His first successful film, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, Blackmail, was the first British sound feature film. Hitchcock's most famous films include the psychological thrillers Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), and Psycho (1960). He also directed successful films such as The 39 Steps (1935), Rebecca (1940), and Notorious (1946). His films have earned him a total of five Academy Award nominations and two wins. Hitchcock was knighted in 1980 for his contribution to film. He died in 1980 at the age of 80.</p><table class="table table-col-2"><tbody readability=3.568345323741><tr><td>Popular As</td><td>Alfred Joseph Hitchcock</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>director,producer,actor</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td><a href=#>81 years old</a></td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac Sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>13 August, <a href=#>1899</a></td></tr><tr><td>Birthday</td><td>13 August</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birthplace</td><td>Leytonstone, Essex, England</td></tr><tr><td>Date of death</td><td>April 29, 1980</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Died Place</td><td>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td><a href=#>United Kingdom</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We recommend you to check the complete list of Famous People born on 13 August.

His funeral was held in the Church of Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.</p><p>On March 7, 1979, Hitchcock was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award, where he said: "I beg permission to mention by name only four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation, and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen and their names are <a href=#>Alma Reville</a>. " By this time, he was ill with angina and his kidneys had already started to fail. He had started to write a screenplay with <a href=#>Ernest Lehman</a> called The Short Night but he fired Lehman and hired young writer <a href=#>David Freeman</a> to rewrite the script. Due to Hitchcock's failing health the film was never made, but Freeman published the script after Hitchcock's death.</p><p>In late 1979, Hitchcock was knighted, making him Sir Alfred Hitchcock.</p><p>From 1977 until his death, he worked with a succession of writers on a film to be known as "The Short Night". The majority of the writing was done by <a href=#>David Freeman</a>, who published the final screenplay after Hitchcock's death.</p><p>He was reportedly furious when Brian De Palma decided to make Obsession (1976), because he thought it was a virtual remake of Vertigo (1958). Ironically, De Palma stopped making mystery/adventure films after Hitchcock's death in 1980, with the possible exception of Body Double (1984).</p><p>On April 29, 1974, the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York sponsored a gala homage to Alfred Hitchcock and his contributions to the cinema. Three hours of film excerpts were shown that night. François Truffaut who had published a book of interviews with Hitchcock a few years earlier, was there that night to present "two brilliant sequences: the clash of the cymbals in the second version of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) , and the plane attack on Cary Grant in North by Northwest (1959)." After the gala, Truffaut reflected again on what made Hitchcock unique and concluded: "It was impossible not to see that the love scenes were filmed like murder scenes, and the murder scenes like love scenes...It occurred to me that in Hitchcock's cinema...to make love and to die are one and the same.".</p><p>During the making of Frenzy (1972), Hitchcock's wife Alma suffered a paralyzing stroke which made her unable to walk very well.</p><p>On August 2, 1968, he visited Finland to scout filming locations for his next film "The Short Night". Of course, the film was never made. In the airport, he was interviewed by Finnish reporters. He was asked why his films were so popular. His answer was: "Everybody likes to be scared".</p><p>He never won a best director Academy Award in competition, although he was awarded the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award at the 1967 Academy Awards.</p><p>He allegedly refused the British honour of CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1962.</p><p>Lent his name and character to a series of adolescent books entitled "Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators" (circa late 1960s - early 1970s). The premise was that main character and crime-solver Jupiter Jones won the use of Mr. Hitchcock's limousine in a contest. Hitch also wrote forewords to this series of books. After his death, his famous silhouette was taken off the spine of the books, and the forewords (obviously) stopped appearing as well.</p><p>Was close friends with <a href=#>Albert R. Broccoli</a>, well known as the producer of the James Bond - 007 franchise. Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) was the influence for the helicopter scene in From Russia with Love (1963). Actors Sean Connery, <a href=#>Karin Dor</a>, <a href=#>Louis Jourdan</a> and <a href=#>Anthony Dawson</a> have appeared in both a Hitchcock film and a Bond film.</p><p>Asked writers <a href=#>Pierre Boileau</a> and <a href=#>Thomas Narcejac</a> to write a novel for him after <a href=#>Henri-Georges Clouzot</a> had been faster in buying the rights for "Celle qui n'était plus" which became Diabolique (1955). The novel they wrote, "From Among the Dead", was shot as Vertigo (1958).</p><p><a href=#>Alma Reville</a> and Hitchcock had one daughter, <a href=#>Patricia Hitchcock</a>, who appeared in three of his movies: Stage Fright (1950), Strangers on a Train (1951) and Psycho (1960).</p><p>Had a hard time devising one of his signature walk-ons for Lifeboat (1944), a film about a small group of people trying to survive on a small boat. What he eventually came up with was to have his picture in a newspaper advertisement for weight loss that floated among some debris around the boat. He had happened to have lost a considerable amount of weight from dieting around that time, so he was seen in both the "Before" and the "After" pictures. The text of the ad uses the tag line, "Obesity Slayer".</p><p>Often said that Shadow of a Doubt (1943) was his favorite film among those he had directed.</p><p>After Saboteur (1942), as his fame as a director grew, film companies began to refer to his films as 'Alfred Hitchcock's', for example Alfred Hitcock's Psycho (1960), Alfred Hitchcock's Family Plot (1976), Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972). Hitchcock was a master of pure cinema who almost never failed to reconcile aesthetics with the demands of the box-office.</p><p>Directed eight different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, <a href=#>Albert Bassermann</a>, Michael Chekhov, Claude Rains, Ethel Barrymore and <a href=#>Janet Leigh</a>. Fontaine won an Oscar for Suspicion (1941).</p><p>In 1940, the Hitchcock family moved to Hollywood, where the producer David O.</p><p>Selznick had hired him to direct an adaptation of 'Daphne du Maurier''s Rebecca (1940).</p><p>His success followed when he made a number of films in Britain such as The Lady Vanishes (1938) and Jamaica Inn (1939), some of which also gained him fame in the USA.</p><p>First visited Hollywood in the late 1930s, but was turned down by virtually all major motion picture studios because they thought he could not make a Hollywood-style picture. He was finally offered a seven-year directing contract by producer David O. Selznick. His first project was supposed to be a film about the Titanic, but Selznick scrapped the project because he "couldn't find a boat to sink." Selznick assigned Hitch to direct Rebecca (1940) instead, which later won the best picture Oscar.</p><p>Hitchcock made his first trademark film in 1927, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927). In the same year, on the 2nd of December, Hitchcock married <a href=#>Alma Reville</a>.</p><p>He directed The Pleasure Garden (1925), a British/German production, which was very popular.</p><p>It was only after the director for Always Tell Your Wife (1923) fell ill and Hitchcock was named director to complete the film that he and Reville began to collaborate.</p><p>Hitchcock had his first real crack at directing a film, start to finish, in 1923 when he was hired to direct the film Number 13 (1922), though the production wasn't completed due to the studio's closure (he later remade it as a sound film). Hitchcock didn't give up then.</p><p>Der müde Tod (1921) by Fritz Lang was his declared favorite movie.</p><p>It was around 1920 when Hitchcock joined the film industry. He started off drawing the sets (he was a very skilled artist). It was there that he met <a href=#>Alma Reville</a>, though they never really spoke to each other.</p><p>His first job outside of the family business was in 1915 as an estimator for the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company. His interest in movies began at around this time, frequently visiting the cinema and reading US trade journals.</p><p>He had two older siblings, William Hitchcock (born 1890) and Eileen Hitchcock (born 1892). Raised as a strict Catholic and attending Saint Ignatius College, a school run by Jesuits, Hitch had very much of a regular upbringing.</p><p>Alfred Joseph Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone, Essex, England. He was the son of <a href=#>Emma Jane</a> (Whelan; 1863 - 1942) and East End greengrocer William Hitchcock (1862 - 1914). His parents were both of half English and half Irish ancestry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrmnvsSdZKGhpJi1pLvCpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-olivera-knew-tom-schwartz-needed-a-hug-post-scandoval.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Danielle Olivera Knew Tom Schwartz Needed a 'Hug' Post-Scandoval</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-felipe-dos-santos-girlfriend-dating-history-and-relationship-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Felipe DOs Santos Girlfriend?
