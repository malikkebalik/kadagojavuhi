However, after watching the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and being influenced by Royce Gracie, he shifted his attention to martial arts in 1998, particularly jiu-jitsu.</p><p>He finally began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Coach Angelo Exeherako in 2000 and received his blue belt after only six months of training. Angelo had to leave his coaching job shortly afterward, so Firas was invited to substitute him at the TriStar Gym, a mixed martial arts training center based in Le Triangle Borough in Montreal.</p><p>He took up the job and began to seek a career as a head coach and instructor. In 2007, the Canadian professional kickboxer and actor Conrad Plas, who was the gym’s founder and director, agreed to hand the company over to Firas.</p><p>He became the mentor of George Saint Pierre, a professional UFC welterweight champion, during the same year. Four years later, under John Danaher, Firas earned his black belt. Firas has been working as a coach since then and has been focusing on his business as well.</p><p>Now married to his long-time girlfriend Melissa Gendron, she and Firas have three children, two sons Ayman Zahabi and Noah Zahabi, and a daughter Alissa Dean Zahabi.
