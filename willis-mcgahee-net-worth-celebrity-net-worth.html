Willis McGahee played in the NFL from 2003 to 2013. After starting out with the Buffalo Bills, he played for the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos, and finally the Cleveland Browns. Before joining the NFL, McGahee was a BCS national champion and consensus All-American with the University of Miami Hurricanes.</p><h2 id=insurance-gamble-amp-career-earnings><strong>Insurance Gamble & Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>At the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, Willis suffered a gruesome injury during the fourth quarter of the game. The injury required several surgeries and at the time it was highly unlikely that he would ever play football again. <a href=#>Willis had the ability to cash in a $2.5 million insurance policy</a> he had taken out before the game. However if he took the insurance money, he would not have been able to enter the NFL Draft. It was a huge gamble. But it paid off! The Buffalo Bills signed him in 2003 and during his NFL career Willis would eventually earn $35 million in salary.</p><h2 id=early-life-high-school><strong>Early Life and High School</strong></h2><p>Willis McGahee III was born on October 21, 1981 in Miami, Florida. As a teenager, he went to Miami Springs High School and then Miami Central High School.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>For college, McGahee attended the University of Miami and played for the Hurricanes football team from 2000 to 2002. With the team in 2001, he won the BCS National Championship. McGahee's best season at Miami, however, was his final one, as he helped lead the Hurricanes to an undefeated regular season and broke numerous school season records, including for all-purpose yards (2,108). For the 2002 season, he was named Big East Offensive Player of the Year and a consensus All-American. McGahee's time with the Hurricanes came to a difficult end during the 2003 BCS National Championship Game when he suffered ACL, PCL, and MCL tears. He subsequently underwent several surgeries and a long period of rehabilitation before he could play again.</p><h2 id=buffalo-bills><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></h2><p>In the 2003 NFL Draft, McGahee was chosen in the first round with the 23rd overall pick by the Buffalo Bills. However, due to extensive rehabilitation for his knee, he missed the entire 2003 season. McGahee would go on to make his debut for the Bills in Week 1 of the 2004 season in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. In Week 8, he scored his first two career touchdowns, and the following week posted season highs with 37 carries for 132 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. McGahee finished the 2004 season with 284 carries for 1,128 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns, as well as 22 receptions for 169 receiving yards. For the season, he was named PFWA Comeback Player of the Year.</p><p>McGahee had another solid season in 2005, starting out strong with 22 carries for 117 rushing yards in a victory over the Houston Texans. He finished the season with 325 carries for 1,247 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns, plus 28 receptions for 178 receiving yards. In the 2006 season, McGahee recorded 259 carries for 990 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns, as well as 18 receptions for 156 receiving yards. After that season, he made denigratory comments about the city of Buffalo that ultimately contributed to him being traded by the Bills.</p><h2 id=baltimore-ravens><strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong></h2><p>McGahee was traded to the Baltimore Ravens prior to the 2007 season. In his first season with the team, he recorded 294 carries for 1,207 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. McGahee also earned his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007 thanks to five 100-plus-yard games and a streak of seven consecutive games with a rushing touchdown. However, due to a cracked rib late in the season, he fell just short of having his best career rushing season. Despite suffering various other injuries during the 2008 season, McGahee managed to rush for 671 yards and seven touchdowns. Moreover, he helped lead the Ravens to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth. McGahee was a key player in the postseason, leading the Ravens to the AFC Championship Game. In the game, he was removed from the field on a stretcher after being hit by Ryan Clark, and the Pittsburgh Steelers went on to win the Championship.</p><p>McGahee was the Ravens' leading scorer in the 2009 season, with 14 combined touchdowns. He finished the season with his best career game, posting 167 rushing yards on 16 carries and three rushing touchdowns in a victory over the Oakland Raiders. The Ravens went on to rout the New England Patriots in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round. In the 2010 season, McGahee recorded 100 carries for 380 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns, plus 14 receptions for 55 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. The Ravens once again reached the Divisional Round, this time losing to the Steelers. In the 2011 offseason, McGahee was released by the Ravens so the team could free up salary cap space.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-250707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GettyImages-121139264.jpg alt="Willis McGahee net worth and career earnings" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-250707 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=denver-broncos><strong>Denver Broncos</strong></h2><p>Following his release from the Ravens, McGahee signed a four-year contract with the Denver Broncos. He had a strong first season with the team in 2011, recording 249 carries for 1,199 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns, plus 12 receptions for 51 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. McGahee also earned his second career Pro Bowl selection. In an injury-plagued 2012 season, he finished with 167 carries for 731 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns, as well as 26 receptions for 221 receiving yards. The next year, McGahee was waived by the Broncos due to health concerns.</p><h2 id=cleveland-browns><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></h2><p>McGahee finished his professional playing career with the Cleveland Browns in 2013. That season, he recorded 138 carries for 377 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in 12 games.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>McGahee is infamous for having multiple children with many different women. Reportedly, he already had 10 children by nine different women by the time he was 32. Due to his checkered romantic life, McGahee starred in the first season of the E! reality television series "Famously Single" in 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jrCgpaSZqHqur8aan56dXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-santino-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew Santino Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-gotye-dating-gotye-s-girlfriend-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gotye Dating Gotye's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
