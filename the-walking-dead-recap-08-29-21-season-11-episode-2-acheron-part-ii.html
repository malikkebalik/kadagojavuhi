Negan catches up with the others and lies, saying Maggie was right behind him. They hide in a train car. They plan to keep moving, that is what she would want. Daryl sneaks out the side and looks around at the dead bodies, people’s belongings, their artwork on the tunnel walls.</p><p>Still being held hostage at the Commonwealth, Princess and Yumiko talk. Yumiko plans to talk to the people in charge. She thinks she can reason with them and find out about her brother. Eugene arrives. He is frantic they will find out what they did. Yumiko has had it. She wants to talk to who is in charge. She wants information on her brother and Ezekiel.</p><p>Daryl finds a message left for someone on a $100 dollar bill. He also finds food and sees a map of the tunnels on the wall. Just as he gets a closer look there is a scream. Dog runs off. Daryl chases after him. Dog goes down a tunnel.</p><p>Yumiko waits to find out more as the assessors write notes. She gets mad and turns the table on them, giving them her assessment. It appears she is right. They look nervous. She is brought coffee after she tells them she is looking for her brother.</p><p>Maggie makes it back to the group and goes right for Negan. He confesses he didn’t help her.</p><p>Just when they are deciding whether to kill Negan or not, Gage yells from the next train car. He needs to be let in. Maggie says sorry, they cannot open the door. They don’t have the ammo. He calls her a liar, stabs himself several times as they watch walkers tear him apart.</p><p>Eugene waits to find out what is going on. The guards took Princess and now he waits alone. Meanwhile, no one wants to look through the train car glass at Gage who is now a walker. Alden is mad that they won’t look. It was a horrid death for Gage but Maggie disagrees. She tells them all a story of women she found in a house with no legs, arms, tongues. That is what is out there. Life is evil.</p><p>Daryl comes through the tunnel after chasing dog. He kills several walkers. He finds one of their own. He is bleeding, badly. He Hans Daryl his gun. He is beyond help and wants his kids to know he didn’t die a coward. Meanwhile, the walkers are pushing with so much force, Maggie and the others need to get out fo the train car but the next car is blocked.</p><p>The walkers break down the door. The father, Maggie, and the others work to take them down one by one. The other car begins to fill. Negan runs to that side. Daryl hears the shots and comes to help. He ends up on the train car where Negan is trying to get in. He takes out a line of walkers, lets the others in, and then stuffs a grenade in a walker’s mouth. They all get down.</p><p>Back at the Commonwealth, Eugene is called into the assessors. He is given one more chance, to tell the truth. He shares his story of talking with a woman by radio, his mission to find her, and that he is a virgin. They accept them all into the Commonwealth. Eugene meets the real Stephanie.</p><p>Maggie and the gang rest and talk about what they plan to do next when they are attacked by the reapers.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWpnpJ2ybsPApaKippdisaatw2apnpuRpXpxhIxrcGZqYWLApq3SqKVmaWFisrG10qibnmViYq6ktMSrpqdloJa%2FtXnIomY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-get-heat-resistant-armor-in-botw.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to Get Heat Resistant Armor in 'BOTW'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-stack-4857-broadway-unit-6a-1-bed-apt-for-rent-for-2-069.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Stack, 4857 Broadway, Unit 6A - 1 Bed Apt for Rent for $2,069</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
