The couple tied the knot in 2022 after first falling in love and getting engaged 20 years prior. In 2024, Affleck and Lopez are allegedly headed for divorce — and they put their <a href=#>Beverly Hills mansion up for sale</a>. Here’s what a divorce mediator said will happen if Lopez and Affleck sell their home while planning to split.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-don-t-have-to-split-the-proceeds-from-the-sale-of-their-mansion-evenly>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck don’t have to split the proceeds from the sale of their mansion evenly</h2><p id=par-2_60><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck</a> are allegedly headed down the path to divorce. Several sources close to the couple claimed a few months into 2024 that they had deep marriage incompatibilities. Now, Lopez and Affleck are planning to sell their 38,000-square-foot, 12-bedroom, 24-bathroom Beverly Hills mansion for $68 million. The couple bought the property for $60 million in June 2023.</p><p id=par-3_32>Joe Dillon, divorce mediator and financial negotiation expert at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Equitable Mediation</a>, told Showbiz Cheat Sheet in a statement that the couple doesn’t have to split the proceeds from the house sale evenly.</p><p id=par-4_32>“Selling the family home and dividing the proceeds can be a good option for some divorcing couples. However, contrary to popular belief, there’s no requirement to split the money evenly,” Dillon said.</p><p id=par-5_40>“In the United States, divorcing couples can negotiate how they’ll share the money from the house sale,” he continued. “This process may result in an agreement where one person might receive a larger portion of the proceeds than the other.”</p><p id=par-6_65>“The final division —&nbsp;in my experience —&nbsp;depends on what both parties consider fair, taking into account various aspects of their marriage and individual circumstances,” Dillon added. “Factors that might influence this decision include each person’s financial contribution to the home, one party’s need for liquidity to purchase another home, or in exchange for offering the other party a larger share of a different marital asset.”</p><p id=par-7_41>Does this mean Lopez and Affleck will try to take more money from the other if the house sells? Only time will tell. However, given their past divorces, we expect Lopez and Affleck to split amicably if they go that route.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-celebrity-realtor-says-the-couple-really-wants-to-sell-the-house-as-quickly-as-possible>A celebrity realtor says the couple ‘really’ wants to sell the house as quickly as possible</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jennifer-Lopez-Ben-Affleck-1-3.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-8_66>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck purchased their Beverly Hills mansion in 2023. Now, in 2024, they’re ready to sell it. Celebrity realtor Josh Flagg told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that because the listing price is “relatively close to what they paid for it,” Lopez and Affleck “really want to move the property.” Flagg added that he expects the couple to possibly “take a small loss” from the house sale.</p><p id=par-9_23>Another real estate source told People that Lopez and Affleck initially received “very little interest” in the house when they privately listed it.</p><p id=par-10_10>“Publicly listing it was the next natural step,” they continued.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ben-affleck-has-been-living-in-a-100-000-monthly-rental-for-months>Ben Affleck has been living in a $100,000 monthly rental for months</h2><p id=par-11_55>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez <a href=#>publicly listed their mansion</a> for sale in July 2024.

The apartment lies only two blocks from his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.</p><p id=par-12_45>“Ben continues to live at the Brentwood rental,” a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> in June 2024. “He’s been there for about two months now.
