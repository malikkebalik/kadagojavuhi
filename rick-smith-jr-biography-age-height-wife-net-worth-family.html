After throwing a card at a friend in jest and accidentally slicing his arm, it became clear that Smith possessed an unusual talent for the sport. In the days and weeks that followed, he alerted the local press that he would be attempting to break the record for distance of a playing card throw in CSU’s Wolstein Center. On March 21 of 2002, at the age of 21, Smith obtained the world record for the farthest distance a playing card had ever been thrown.</p><p>After his accomplishment was publicized on Cleveland’s newspapers and TV channels, Smith began to be contacted by national television programs who requested that he perform his first live televised card throwing stunt on their show. He made his first TV appearance on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, demonstrating his card throwing abilities in speed, distance, and precision.</p><p>Since making his debut on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not in 2002, Smith has appeared on national television a number of times. His performances have been broadcast live on shows such as The Ellen Degeneres Show, Shark Tank, The Tonight Show, and America’s Got Talent. He has also appeared on Dude Perfect, a popular YouTube channel that records videos involving various tricks and stunts. Recently he has been involved in the YouTube Red series, The Super Slow Show, starring <a href=#>Gavin Free</a> and Daniel Gruchy, showing off his card throwing ability to cut through almost three whole celery stalks.</p><p>Throughout his career, Smith has released a series of instructional movies aimed at audiences hoping to learn the basics of magic or card throwing. His releases include: Xtreme Beginnerz Card Handling Skills, which explains the basics of card throwing, pen spinning, and dice stacking; The Art of Card Throwing with <a href=#>Rick Smith</a> Jr., which explains techniques for card throwing in greater detail; and Velocity (in collaboration with Murphy’s Magic), which also launches into the specific practices and skills necessary to be a masterful card thrower.</p><p><a href=#>Richard Smith</a> Jr. (born 5 March 1981) is a professional illusionist and card thrower from Cleveland, Ohio.
