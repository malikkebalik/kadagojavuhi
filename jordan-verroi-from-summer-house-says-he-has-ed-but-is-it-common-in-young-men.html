He made out with Danielle Olivera but then blew her off when things got a little hot and heavy.</p><p id=par-2_34>He also told a pretty tall tale about how he lost his virginity. Additionally, he played it cool with the men, telling them he made out with three women in a single evening.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jordan-Verroi.jpg><p id=par-3_32>The friends in the house seem confused about Verroi’s game. They are pretty confident he’s not the player he claims to be, but aren’t sure if perhaps he’s hiding something more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hannah Berner thinks he’s having identity issues</h2><p id=par-4_65><a href=#>Berner</a> knew Verroi before joining the Summer House cast and dished with Diana Espir from the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>You Can’t Sit With ME</a> podcast. She wondered if perhaps he was still a virgin and trying to hide it. “When you are lying so much you are clearly trying to cover, a truth,” Berner told Espir. “He never said what he is hiding. Or that he is hiding something.”</p><p id=par-5_50>She also gave her thoughts during Bravo’s <a href=#>The Daily Dish</a> podcast too. “I’ve always had his back because he really is an amazing person; he’s really a kind, kind soul,” she said. “He would never hurt a fly. I just think he’s working on who he is as a person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/summer-house.jpg><p id=par-6_59>“I’m from New York City so I don’t know what it’s like growing up in the South with a military family, super religious, and then living in New York City, so I feel like he’s dealing with a lot of identity questions and not going about it the best way but I have hope for him,” she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>But then he reveals he has erectile dysfunction</h2><p id=par-7_42>He told Kyle Cooke he opened up to the ladies in the house and told them he actually suffers from erectile dysfunction or ED. He says he’s been acting differently because of “something that’s been going on with me,” he revealed.</p><p id=par-8_30>“These past couple months I’ve been having like uh, erectile dysfunction issues,” he tells Cooke. Cooke looks stunned saying that he did not expect Verroi to tell him that.</p><p id=par-9_54>Cooke says, “The brain is a tricky thing and so is the little brain. Is it happening with a specific girl multiple times?” Verroi says no but rather, two girls. At this point, Cooke is skeptical that Verroi has ED. He thinks either Verroi is not aroused by women or is a virgin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is ED common amongst young men?</h2><p id=par-10_73>Verroi may indeed be suffering from ED as it is possible in younger men, according to <a href=#>Healthline</a>. A recent UK study found about half of men in their thirties have ED and more than one-third of men under age thirty deal with the disorder. However, other researchers do not believe these numbers are as accurate as some men reported having an issue occasionally, which may not fit the traditional definition of ED.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_38>According to Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, the definition is a disorder that is more sustained. ED is “the persistent and consistent inability to maintain an erection through satisfactory intercourse.”</p><p id=par-12_24>Culprits are linked to cardiovascular disease, but also other stress-inducing factors. This may include excessive drinking, fatigue, and anxiety as a contributing factor.</p><p id=par-13_5>Check out&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sL7DmqVmrpWnv7C1jJ%2BpqKVdqMKuucSrZKGnpaiybr%2FAsqpmoJVitaK%2FjJ6bZpqlqXqqv4yiq2abn6K6sLqMoqVmsZ%2Bqu6h5zJ6lZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./orlando-bloom-net-worth-and-how-he-makes-his-money.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Orlando Bloom Net Worth and How He Makes His Money</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-ambrose-o-brien-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J.
