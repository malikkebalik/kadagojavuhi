Richard Linklater’s&nbsp;Dazed And Confused, John Hughes’ The Breakfast Club and, more recently, Stephen Chbosky’s&nbsp;The Perks Of Being A Wallflower&nbsp;all come to mind as teen-targeted movies which&nbsp;accurately translated some of the humor, heartbreak and restlessness of their respective eras to the big screen (though&nbsp;Perks is recent, it’s an adaptation of Chbosky’s influential ’90s novel).</p><p data-characters=767 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=#>Palo</a><a href=#> Alto</a></strong>&nbsp;deserves to rank among those classics of teen cinema.&nbsp;Like them, it holds a magnifying glass up to modern teenagers, finds something of value to say about their lives and communicates its&nbsp;message with impressive elegance. However, as directed by Gia Coppola (yes, niece of Sofia, granddaughter of Francis Ford),&nbsp;Palo Alto takes a detached, almost documentarian approach to charting the indiscretions of its subjects. Unlike Linklater, Hughes and Chbosky, Coppola has chosen to excise the feel-good kitsch almost entirely, instead peddling in the familiar terrors of illicit drugs, casual sex, pointless violence and, perhaps even worse, all-consuming apathy. The result is a staggeringly powerful drama which disquiets&nbsp;in just how loudly&nbsp;it resonates.</p><p data-characters=773 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>Coppola (who also penned the script, massively improving upon&nbsp;James Franco’s mediocre short story collection of the same name) builds her narrative around three deeply troubled high schoolers living in the titular locale, an affluent California suburb. The timid, virginal and possibly depressed April (Emma Roberts) harbors a crush on her sketchy soccer coach Mr. B (Franco)&nbsp;while also quietly pining after sensitive&nbsp;pothead Teddy (Jack Kilmer). Meanwhile, Teddy tries&nbsp;to clean up his act and control his reckless best friend Fred (Nat Wolff), a hellraiser with borderline-suicidal tendencies. And Fred’s occasional hookup Emily (Zoe Levin) has her own set of problems, trading sexual favors to Teddy, Fred and others in hopes of making&nbsp;a real connection.</p><p data-characters=728 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>As all three teens struggle to articulate their dissatisfaction&nbsp;with the drug-fueled&nbsp;ennui of their generation, they come close to grand revelations about the nature of their “affluenza,” as a recent hot-button court case about similarly&nbsp;entitled, ungoverned teens put it. But Coppola’s film isn’t meant to lecture. Like aunt Sofia’s&nbsp;The Bling Ring,&nbsp;Palo Alto&nbsp;takes a nearly&nbsp;clinical, removed&nbsp;approach, never passing judgment on its&nbsp;characters. And unlike that far inferior film,&nbsp;Palo Alto&nbsp;still manages to get under the skin of its typically unsympathetic protagonists. In doing so, Coppola elicits the necessary empathy to draw&nbsp;her audience into her characters’&nbsp;troubled lives.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/palo-alto1-613x360.jpg alt="palo alto" width=613 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Roberts has always struck me as a talented actress stuck in terrible roles, and she really comes into her own here. April is a tricky character, oscillating between moments of youthful&nbsp;happiness and abject despair, but the actress handles it with admirable restraint. Even when April’s decisions are poor, Roberts&nbsp;lets us inside her head and makes her highly identifiable.</p><p data-characters=686 data-current-count=1066 data-injectable=true>Kilmer, making one hell of a big-screen debut, plays Teddy as a noble-hearted but easily led teen. The actor is a natural in front of the camera (not much of a surprise considering his parentage), turning what could have been a one-note character into a compelling, complicated protagonist. And Levin makes the most of a less well-written role, filling even her silences with poignant desperation. The biggest surprise, though, is Wolff, who attacks his role with a terrifying, pent-up ferocity. Fred, a self-destructive sociopath, is a far cry from Wolff’s typical nice-guy roles, but the actor is&nbsp;scarily convincing, particularly during&nbsp;the film’s nail-biting final act.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>The adults, too, benefit from Coppola’s strong writing and direction. As&nbsp;a dangerously charismatic predator, Franco is extremely effective (audiences may look at the performance in a different light now that Franco’s flirtations with an underage Instagram fan have come into the public eye),&nbsp;and Chris Messina&nbsp;accomplishes&nbsp;a jaw-dropping amount in his one scene as Fred’s closeted gay father.</p><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>As a showcase for Coppola’s directorial talents,&nbsp;Palo Alto is mightily convincing. Moving the camera in a dreamlike haze, she&nbsp;demonstrates great commitment to detailed&nbsp;mise-en-scene and evocative visuals. Much of the film’s eye-catching appearance should also be accredited to director of photographer Autumn Durald, who has clearly found a kindred spirit in the thoughtful Coppola. Striking images abound, from the&nbsp;heart crudely scrawled into a tree that Teddy and Fred mark for destruction to a lone car barreling down the wrong side of the highway in a last-ditch&nbsp;act of defiance.</p><p data-characters=562 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Coppola also doesn’t neglect the human side of her story. Palo Alto is a visual treat, to be sure, but its achievements stretch far beyond that when you&nbsp;consider how deceptively tight and effective its&nbsp;narrative actually is. The&nbsp;characters struggle, stumble and often&nbsp;fall. However, even if only in an abstract way,&nbsp;Palo Alto‘s conclusion suggests that progress has been&nbsp;made, and that, somehow, in spite of all the battles not yet won, the protagonists’ lives have become a little less dark. Refreshingly, there’s hope to be found.</p><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>I can’t say whether you’ll find as much to love about&nbsp;Palo Alto as I did. It’s sure to divide audiences, based both on its content and on Coppola’s refusal to directly condemn the hedonistic, hard-drinking lifestyles of her characters. She’s more interested in articulating&nbsp;the identity crisis faced by many bored, overindulged teens today than solving it.&nbsp;Still, as a directorial debut,&nbsp;<strong>Palo Alto</strong> is clear, complex&nbsp;and confident. And as a reflection on teen&nbsp;life in America today, it’s bracingly powerful.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fantastic</h5><p class=review-summary>A disturbingly plausible meditation on teen life in America as seen through the eyes of the talented Gia Coppola, Palo Alto is an absolutely stunning accomplishment.</p><p class=review-title>Palo Alto</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJop5qkn2KurcDOZqmerpmaxHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./titus-welliver-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Titus Welliver Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lindsay-lohan-got-herself-a-cracked-out-turban-just-like-elizabeth-taylor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lindsay Lohan got herself a cracked-out turban, just like Elizabeth Taylor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
