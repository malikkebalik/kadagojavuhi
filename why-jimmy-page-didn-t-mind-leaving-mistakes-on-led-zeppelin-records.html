According to polls of professional musicians, fans, and critics, the force behind <a href=#>Led Zeppelin</a> usually ranks in the top three. In fact, only Jimi Hendrix consistently ranks ahead of him. (Page also <a href=#>called Hendrix the greatest</a>.)</p><p id=par-2_42>That doesn’t mean Page was perfect, of course. Even when Aerosmith’s Joe Perry sang his praises for Rolling Stone’s “100 Greatest Guitarists,” he mentioned how Page (No. 3) could be heard “<a href=#>teetering on the edge of his technique</a>” on the “Heartbreaker” solo.</p><p id=par-3_41>If you do a bit of searching, you’ll find other guitar pros (and armchair listeners) calling Page’s technique into question. While some point to mistakes he’d make during live shows, others have cited the flubs Page left on <a href=#>Zep’s studio albums</a>.</p><p id=par-4_34>For a meticulous producer like Page, these mistakes couldn’t have been an accident. In interviews over the years, he’s spoken of leaving in mistakes because he thought it sounded realer than heavily edited albums.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Page said he preferred ‘being honest about’ guitar mistakes on record</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/plant-page-1975.jpg><p id=par-5_43>In a 1977 interview with Guitar World’s Steve Rosen, Page didn’t seem embarrassed at all by mistakes he’d left on record. This time, the issue came up with “I Can’t Quit You Babe,” another signature early Zep track (off <a href=#>the band’s 1969 debut</a>).</p><p id=par-6_51>After Rosen described Page’s solo as “<a href=#>sloppy but amazingly inventive</a>,” Page noted that it didn’t bother him. “There are mistakes in it, but it doesn’t make any difference,” he said. “You’ve got to be reasonably honest about it.” Of course, part of it came down to Page’s habit of recording solos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_51>“I usually just limber up for a while and then maybe do three solos and take the best of three,” Page explained. He also compared it to his live performances. When the band released <a href=#>The Song Remains the Same</a>, the material didn’t come close to Zeppelin’s best nights in concert.</p><p id=par-8_46>But Page left it in nonetheless. “It’s a very honest film track,” he told Rosen. “Rather than just trailing around through a tour with a recording mobile truck waiting for the magic night, it was just, ‘There you are – take it or leave it.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Page considered his composing more important than his playing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jimmy-page-1975.jpg><p id=par-9_51>Given Page’s epic axe-work with Led Zep — following <a href=#>his run as session whiz</a> in London recording studios — it’s clear why most people peg him as strictly a guitar god. However, Page’s biggest admirers put him in the pantheon for the composing and producing work he also did with Zep.</p><p id=par-10_52>“Jimmy wasn’t just a genius in the way he played; he was <a href=#>a genius in how he recorded too</a>,” Kiss’s Bruce Kulick said of Page (No. 2) in the Louder Sound best guitarist rankings. Page has long considered his work as a composer, arranger, and producer to be his most important contribution.</p><p id=par-11_38>“My vocation is more in composition, really, than in anything else,” he said in 1977. “Building up harmonies, orchestrating the guitar like an army – a guitar army – I think that’s where it’s at, really, for me.”</p><p id=par-12_42>So what is the greatest showcase for all of Page’s talents (songwriting, arranging, producing, and playing)? It’s a great debate, but a few songs from the later albums stand out. If “<a href=#>Ten Years Gone</a>” doesn’t get you, “<a href=#>Achilles Last Stand</a>” surely will.</p><p id=par-13_14><strong>Also see</strong><strong>: </strong><a href=#><strong>The Only Led Zeppelin Song Robert Plant Shared With Another Lead Vocalist</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqcWMo6CmpalivaKzxGabopyeqXqutc2dZKWdkau2r7OMpqCsrJGgsrR5zqdkpZ2UYsemvM%2Beo6KmXaeypLvRnapnoKSiuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grantchester-star-tom-brittney-played-this-character-in-outlander-season-1-and-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Grantchester' Star Tom Brittney Played This Character in 'Outlander' Season 1 and 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./magic-the-gathering-reveals-exclusive-cards-for-love-your-lgs-promotion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Magic: The Gathering Reveals Exclusive Cards For Love Your LGS Promotion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
