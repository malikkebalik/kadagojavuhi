The Try Guys started as a content sensation at Buzzfeed before Ned, Zach Kornfeld, Keith Habersberger, and Eugene Lee Yang took their try videos onto their own <a href=#>YouTube </a>channel. Together, the four business partners and friends formed 2nd Try LLC, a company that controlled all The Try Guys’ content and additional projects. Things were going exceedingly well. The foursome expanded their business, added employees, and saw astronomical growth in popularity. Then, Ned Fulmer, who used his marriage as a personality trait, was <a href=#>caught cheating</a>. He left 2nd Try LLC, but did he leave the lives of Eugene, Zach, and Keith, too? It looks like it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why did Ned Fulmer leave The Try Guys?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_43>Ned Fulmer’s departure from The Try Guys was completely unexpected. In early September 2022, rumors began swirling around&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit&nbsp;</a>that Ned was cheating on his wife and the mother of his two children, Ariel Fulmer. Those rumors were confirmed via social media later that month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ned-Fulmer.jpg><p id=par-3_109>While the Try Guys did not name names, internet sleuths quickly uncovered that Ned had been cheating with Alex Herring, a producer. Alex was Ned’s subordinate. Alex was engaged during the affair, as well. Ned issued a public apology, stating that his family should have been his top priority, but he had carried on<a href=#> a “consensual” workplace affair</a>. Keith, Zach, and Eugene uploaded a YouTube video explaining the way the matter was investigated and what steps they had taken, as a company, to deal with the issue. Ned was removed from all future The Try Guys videos, including ones that had already been filmed. He also left the company.</p><h2>Is Ned Fulmer still friends with the other Try Guys?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_64>Ned has gone completely underground since news of his firing broke. Keith, Eugene, and Zach <a href=#>addressed the actions </a>they took after they learned Ned was having an affair with an employee of the company. Still, they have been careful not to really discuss the friendship aspect of the incident. Ned is no longer a part of the company, but are they all still friends?&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_84>While it’s impossible to say for certain, several hints suggest Ned Fulmer and his former business partners are no longer pals. Keith, Zach, and Eugene have all opted to stop following Ned on Instagram. Ned is still following all three of his former business partners. While they cut Ned out on social media, they did not do the same to Ariel Fulmer. All three men still follow the mother of two. Neither Ned nor Ariel have posted to the platform since the cheating scandal.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_85>Ariel and Ned Fulmer also appeared to be absent from<a href=#> Zach Kornfeld’s February 2023 wedding</a>. Zach wed his longtime partner, Maggie Bustamante, in an outdoor ceremony that, based on videos shared, looked like a blast. Eugene and Keith served as groomsmen. Matt McLean, Eugene’s partner, and Becky Habersberger, Keith’s wife, served as a bridesman and bridesmaid for Maggie. While neither Zach nor Maggie has addressed it, it’s largely theorized that Ned and Ariel were originally supposed to be a part of the couple’s wedding party.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-did-ariel-fulmer-divorce-her-husband>Did Ariel Fulmer divorce her husband?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_73>Ariel Fulmer might not have been as interested in the limelight as her husband, but she was still an active social media user and participated in projects for 2nd Try LLC. When news of Ned’s cheating broke the internet, she retreated from the spotlight and hasn’t returned. While we can’t know what the state of her marriage is right now, we can say for certain that official divorce paperwork has not been filed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ned-Fulmer-and-wife-with-Keith-and-Wife.jpg><p id=par-8_48>It appears Ned and Ariel are still together but opting to live a much more private life. Still, they have popped up occasionally, including at <a href=#>the Eras Tour</a>. There are no updates on any additional children they may have welcomed or where they are working at this time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2tHnNnptmnqWhuqa%2BjKyroqScYrOztcSnm6xlp57BqXnToZxmrKKueqjB2KxloaydoXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pink-floyd-drummer-nick-mason-s-awesome-car-collection.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pink Floyd Drummer Nick Mason's Awesome Car Collection</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-reasons-i-m-glad-i-lost-my-virginity-at-16.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 Reasons I'm Glad I Lost My Virginity At 16</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
