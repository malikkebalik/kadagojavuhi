I believed that very few people were still watching Castle and that no one would really care. But you guys did care! So I’m rewarding you with another story about this mess. On Monday, ABC suddenly announced that Stana Katic would be leaving the series at the end of this season, Season 8. ABC and Castle producers want to do a Season 9, but just with Nathan Fillion… and that’s about it. Tamala Jones is leaving the series and Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever haven’t renewed their contracts… yet. Huertas even went <a href=#>on Twitter</a> and called out producers for not telling him personally that Katic was leaving. And both Dever and Huertas made statements about how much they love Katic and Jones too. Which just goes to show you… the beef that was happening on the set was just between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. Speaking of, both Nathan and Stana tweeted about her exit yesterday.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>To the fans: thank you for your support. I love you. 💋✌🏽️</p><p>— Stana Katic (@Stana_Katic) <a href=#>April 19, 2016</a></p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Nx8bkgpmgE</a></p><p>— Nathan Fillion (@NathanFillion) <a href=#>April 19, 2016</a></p><p>If Nathan’s statement seems somewhat cold and impersonal, that’s because they f—king hate each other. Us Weekly had the details on just how bad it had gotten between them:</p><p>Castle on a storm cloud? Following ABC’s stunning announcement on Monday, April 18, that Stana Katic is exiting the popular procedural Castle, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively that the actress and longtime costar Nathan Fillion have been having behind-the-scenes friction… while the two lead characters — who tied the knot during a season 6 episode in 2014 — have a strong bond, the same sadly cannot be said for the stars themselves.</p><p>“Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion completely despise each other,” the source tells Us. “They will not speak when they are off set, and this has been going on for seasons now.”</p><p>“This season, it got so out of hand they made Stana and Nathan go to couples counseling together,” adds the insider, who says that the actress has been in tears on the set because of the tension.</p><p>Katic’s rep tells Us that the actress “had absolutely no issues” with her costar. Fillion’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>Unlike the <a href=#>Archie Panjabi-Julianna Margulies situation</a> where I was firmly on one side (Team Panjabi), I don’t know where to come down on this Katic-Fillion beef. My gut instinct is telling me that if Stana is regularly leaving the set in tears, then he’s a bastard. My gut is also telling me that Nathan was confused by the concept of having an actual equal partnership on and off-screen. He always thought the show was just about Richard Castle, and Beckett supported Castle’s stories. But… the writers and producers seemed to want Castle and Beckett to be equals. So there was just a fundamental misjudgment on someone’s part. So, I don’t know… I’m tentatively Team Katic.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wenn2776619.jpg alt=wenn2776619 width=470 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbXBhaoR5e9SslrCdlaC5uqvSrZinmY%2BgrrW1wpilmqyYlrugssilo6KnnpTEpr7EmJ2oqpOasaC1za2mmJufqr2tsdKYmqitnqiyrbXNoGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-correct-formula-for-copper-ii-permanganate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is the correct formula for copper II permanganate?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bizarre-origin-of-the-war-boys-silver-mouths-and-teeth-will-give-you-chills.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Bizarre Origin of the War Boys' Silver Mouths and Teeth Will Give You Chills</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
