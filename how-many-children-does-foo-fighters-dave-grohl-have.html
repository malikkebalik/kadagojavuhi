After rising to fame with Nirvana, Grohl has gone on to have a stunning career as a <a href=#>member of the Foo Fighters</a>.</p><p id=par-2_41>Along the way, he’s racked up points for his amazing on-stage performances and <a href=#>limited social media presence</a>. But, how many kids does Dave Grohl have of his own, and will they follow in his footsteps to carry on his rock legacy?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dave-Grohl.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dave-grohl-rose-to-fame-with-nirvana>Dave Grohl rose to fame with Nirvana&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_77>Dave Grohl knew how he wanted to spend his life from a very young age. He was just 10 years old when he formed his first band, and he dropped out of high school to drum for Scream <a href=#>before joining Nirvana</a>, then a small grunge band without a lot of reach. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Biography</a> reports, Kurt Cobain was quick to accept Grohl as the band’s drummer, and soon after, Nirvana started to pick up attention from major labels.</p><p id=par-4_50>Their first studio album saw amazing success, but it also put a lot of pressure on the previously untested band. Cobain, in particular, <a href=#>struggled with fame</a>, and his suicide has become one of the music world’s most heartbreaking stories. Cobain died in 1994, just three years after the release of&nbsp;Nevermind.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>In 1995, reeling from the death of his friend and the destruction of his band, Grohl formed The Foo Fighters. At first, it was just him. He played multiple instruments and used songs he had written while with Nirvana as he performed vocals.</p><p id=par-6_49>Eventually, he brought on a bassist, drummer, and guitarist. Lightning really did strike twice for Grohl, and The Foo Fighters went on to become one of alternative rock’s defining forces. As a result, Grohl has been in the spotlight for two decades, and he’s shined brightly throughout it all.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dave-grohl-has-three-daughters>Dave Grohl has three daughters&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_56>In the midst of his roaring professional success, he’s been <a href=#>married to Jordyn Blum</a> since 2003. In 2006, the happy couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Violet. In 2009, they added a girl named Harper to the family. The family grew again in 2014 when Grohl and Blum welcomed a baby girl named Ophelia.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_70>Being the father of three daughters keeps Grohl busy, but he finds time to keep making new music, tour, and even <a href=#>troll the Westboro Baptist Church</a> in his spare time. Grohl’s influence on the music industry is matched by his appreciation for the <a href=#>musicians who have influenced him</a>. This love for music and what it means to the world seems to be a quality Grohl passes down to his children.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-violet-has-joined-foo-fighters-on-stage>Violet has joined Foo Fighters on stage</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_49>While all of Grohl’s daughters may follow in his creative footsteps, his oldest has certainly demonstrated her talents behind the microphone. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Things</a> reports, Grohl warmly introduced his daughter Violet as “the best singer he knows” when she joined him on stage at the Leeds Festival in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_56>Earlier this summer, Violet once again took the stage alongside her father at Lollapalooza. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iHeart </a>reports, the duo performed a cover of the song “Nausea” by X. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a>, the young singer also has official credits as a backup vocalist on the album&nbsp;Medicine at Midnight, giving her a strong starting foothold in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6orrYZpqhoZyZv6a6jJ%2BmqGWWnrSpwMSrqmackauybrPRqJ%2BlZpipuq17</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-altman-wiki-bio-age-career-height-family-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Altman: Wiki, Bio, Age, Career, Height, Family, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./demaryius-thomas-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Demaryius Thomas Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
