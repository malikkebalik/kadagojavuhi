Over the years, Seymour took on work for many of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most prestigious fashion labels</a> including Versace, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Marc Jacobs.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_24>Seymour also had a brief stint as an actor, appearing in an episode of&nbsp;Law & Order: Criminal Intent and some Guns N’ Roses videos.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_37>The latter appearances were in conjunction with her whirlwind romance with Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose. Their relationship ended with accusations and lawsuits, and Seymour told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2014 that the relationship was a mistake.</p><p id=par-7_54>“Getting involved with Axl Rose? Clearly a mistake,” she explained. “It taught me a lot, though. He was a violent person, and I realized I never wanted to be around that again. The thrill of the whole rock ‘n’ roll thing wore off. I saw the worst of that world and it soured me.”</p><h2 id=h-stephanie-seymour-has-four-children>Stephanie Seymour has four children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stephanie-Seymour-1.jpg><p id=par-8_62>Prior to her high-profile relationship with Rose, Seymour was briefly married and had a son named Dylan. Later, she met and married Peter Brant, a billionaire art collector and publishing magnate. They met in 1993, and when they married in 1995, he adopted Dylan. Later, the couple had three children of their own: sons Harry and Peter and a daughter named Lily.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_45>The 2014 story for&nbsp;Harper’s Bazaar focused heavily on Seymour’s relationship with sons Harry and Peter, who were raised “out of the spotlight in a sprawling Connecticut mansion.” Both boys became early fashion fans, and they frequently helped their mom pick out her own outfits.</p><p id=par-10_56>Their interests and connections led them to become young adults with ties to the fashion world — and all the excitement that world entailed. Harry, who was 17 during the profile on the family, was an aspiring contemporary artist who came to appreciate the works from his father’s collection that surrounded him as he grew up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-harry-brant-died-of-a-drug-overdose>Harry Brant died of a drug overdose</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_36>Harry Brant would go on to make a splash in the fashion world, becoming renown for his gender-bending style and hip ethos. Sadly, he was found dead of an accidental drug overdose in mid-January 2021.</p><p id=par-12_47>He was just 24. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> reports, Harry and his brother Peter had become known as something of the “male version of wealthy celebrity sisters Paris and Nicky Hilton.” Frequent fixtures in the New York fashion and party scene, Brant’s loss sent ripples out through the community.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_19>Seymour was understandably silent in the days after her son’s death, but she has since issued a statement.</p><p id=par-14_64>As&nbsp;Hello Magazine reports, Seymour used the moment to focus attention on Brant’s relationships and the loss they all felt: “Harry was not just our son. He was also a wonderful brother, loving grandson, favourite uncle and a caring friend. He was a creative, loving and powerful soul that brought light into so many people’s hearts. He was truly a beautiful person inside and out.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMmqmeZZWterTBz56ppqeUmrluv9Oep6GZnp6ybr%2FEsqSoraKoeqS0yKWbq52eY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-reasons-i-m-glad-i-lost-my-virginity-at-16.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 Reasons I'm Glad I Lost My Virginity At 16</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pia-mia-pisses-off-kim-kardashian-the-truth-about-her-relationship-with-kanye-west-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pia Mia Pisses Off Kim Kardashian The Truth About Her Relationship With Kanye West (PHOTOS)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
