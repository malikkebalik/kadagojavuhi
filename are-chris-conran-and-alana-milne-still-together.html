So, when they announced that only certain cast members would be invited to a party, it was clear that drama would ensue. Before the party, Chris and Jessenia seemed to be one of the strongest couples in Paradise. But as soon as Alana arrived at the party, things changed.</p><p id=par-3_44>Jessenia said that Chris and Alana had flirted with one another before the show. He immediately pulled Alana to the side at the party and started kissing her. When Jessenia saw the kiss and asked what was going on, Chris tried to be diplomatic.</p><p id=par-4_40>“Both you guys were on my list and obviously you were my No. 1 and I didn’t think I had feelings with her walking in at all,” he told Jessenia. “And I don’t know what’s going on or what happened.”</p><p id=par-5_25>Things only got worse when Alana and Chris started making out on the dancefloor right in front of Jessenia and the rest of the partygoers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-cast-forces-chris-and-alana-out-of-bachelor-in-paradise>The cast forces Chris and Alana out of ‘Bachelor in Paradise’</h2><p id=par-6_15>When Alana arrived the next day, Chris agreed to go on a date with her.</p><p id=par-7_33>“I know it’s going to upset a lot of you guys,” Chris told the rest of the cast, “but I’m following my heart right now and that’s what I came here to do.”</p><p id=par-8_14>When they returned, Joe Amabile and Riley Christian were visibly upset by Chris’ actions.</p><p id=par-9_19>“You’re ruining it for everyone,” Joe said to Chris. “It does seem like a lot of this was structured.”</p><p id=par-10_44>“If you didn’t say you were the strongest couple in the house, I thought you were the strongest couple in the house,” Riley said. “I thought it until I turned around and your tongue was down another woman’s throat right in front of her.”</p><p id=par-11_18>Riley and Joe told Chris that if he had found love with Alana, they should leave the beach.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-are-chris-and-alana-still-together-after-bachelor-in-paradise>Are Chris and Alana still together after ‘Bachelor in Paradise’?</h2><p id=par-12_15>Chris then decided to leave the show and asked Alana if she would join him.</p><p id=par-13_29>“Leaving&nbsp;Paradise&nbsp;together means that you want to be in a committed relationship and after one day here I cannot tell you that,” she said. “And I’m sorry, but I can’t.”</p><p id=par-14_44>Despite not wanting to be in a committed relationship with Chris, Alana still left the show as she felt alienated. When they left BIP, Chris tried to get in the car with Alana but she made him take his own van to the airport.</p><p id=par-15_40>Since the episode aired, Chris and Alana have not updated fans on their relationship status. However, Chris posted a bullying resource to his Instagram Story and tagged Alana in it, writing “in case you need it. Keep your head up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvoq%2FHnqOoql2eu268wKuYnaGjmnqktNGiqmabn6O%2ForqMmqOappFiuqq4zZ5krKyZobluwM6gnK2glad7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-faiers-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Faiers Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hilton-on-djing-i-ve-been-training-for-6-8-hours-a-day-for-a-year.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton on DJing: Ive been training for 6-8 hours a day for a year</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
