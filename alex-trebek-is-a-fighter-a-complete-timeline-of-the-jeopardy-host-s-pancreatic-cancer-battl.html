Although the timeline of his journey has been filled with ups and downs, the iconic <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a> host has shown extreme bravery in his fight against the illness.</p><p>“He always says, ‘<a href=#>No matter what, I power through</a>,'” a friend of Alex exclusively shared with Closer Weekly following the TV star’s heartbreaking announcement. “He really is hopeful. He’s got all the help and the care money can buy.”</p><p>According to the pal, the former Concentration host’s doctors made his diagnosis after he went for his annual checkup. “He knew he was feeling a little bit off, but he didn’t know the reason,” the insider explained. However, the cancer prognosis didn’t get him down as he “loves his life, his work and his family,” the friend added. “He knows what a privileged, blessed life he has … and he wants more of it.”</p><p>Fortunately for Alex, he’s had endless help from his longtime wife, <a href=#><strong>Jean Currivan Trebek</strong></a>. The iconic game show host’s spouse — whom Alex tied the knot with in 1990 — has been <a href=#>using her skills as a sound healer</a> to “uplift him” and give him “a sense of ‘life is beautiful,'” she told <a href=#>Survivornet.com</a> in November 2019.</p><p>It appears the dedicated wife’s gestures don’t go unnoticed. “<a href=#>Jeannie is wonderful</a> … but it’s been a lot. It’s a lot of pressure,” he once told <a href=#>People</a>. “My heart goes out to caregivers. They have to deal with their loved ones suffering and they also don’t always know how to help because there’s not much they can do, except try to make you feel more comfortable, at ease and not worry about ordinary stuff.”</p><p>Jean’s love and support is the reason he remains so positive, <a href=#>a separate friend insisted</a>. “I think that’s part of it. He has the most beautiful [wife] in every way,” his pal Ruta Lee shared with Closer in April. “She’s not only beautiful on the outside but she’s beautiful internally, and spiritually. She’s very very much a handmaid of the Lord’s.”</p><p>Because Alex is so grateful for his family and career, there’s no doubt he won’t give everything he can to win this fight.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see a timeline of Alex’s cancer battle.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao56wXam%2Fpq7EpGSpmZ6Yv6at06KaZpuRo7Cmvoysq5qflWKBbrXNrKCdnV2dvLTA0mafnpmcqbVursCtq6WdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./doris-burke-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Doris Burke Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-madisyn-shipman-dating-madisyn-shipman-s-boyfriend-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Madisyn Shipman Dating Madisyn Shipman's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
