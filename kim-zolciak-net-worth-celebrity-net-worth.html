Kim Zolciak is most widely known for appearing on the Bravo reality series "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" and the spinoff "Don't Be Tardy."</p><p>Kim Zolciak first rose to fame as one of the original cast members of the reality television series "The Real Housewives of Atlanta". Debuting on the show in 2008, Zolciak's extravagant lifestyle, outspoken personality, and sometimes controversial behavior quickly caught the attention of viewers, making her a standout figure.</p><p>In addition to her appearance on RHOA, Kim Zolciak's public profile expanded through her music career. She released her debut single, "Tardy for the Party," in 2009, which became a dance club hit. Although her musical pursuits did not reach the same level of success as her television career, they certainly contributed to her fame.</p><p>Further adding to her celebrity status, Zolciak starred in her spin-off reality show, "Don't Be Tardy," which focuses on her family life with her husband, <a href=# title="Kroy Biermann Net Worth">Kroy Biermann</a>, and their six children. The show has provided a more in-depth look into Zolciak's personal life and the challenges of managing a large family. Outside of entertainment, Zolciak has been involved in various entrepreneurial endeavors, including launching her skincare line.</p><h2 id=foreclosure-financial-problems><strong>Foreclosure and Financial Problems</strong></h2><p>In February 2023 it was reported that Kroy and Kim's Alpharetta mansion was heading to the auction block after slipping into foreclosure.</p><p>In May 2023, the same month she filed for divorce from him, it was reported that Kroy and Kim owed $1.1 million in tax debt. They apparently did not pay any taxes in the years 2013, 2017 and 2018.</p><p>In late August 2023, Kroy filed a petition in a Georgia court asking a judge for permission to sell their Georgia mansion, which he believes could fetch as much as $3 million. Kroy's filing claimed that Kim has put the couple into "significant debt" and "financial devastation." Despite the challenges, Kroy claims to have cobbled together enough money for the mortgage every month through July, staving off foreclosure at least once.</p><p>In October 2023 they finally listed the mansion for $6 million. Clearly if they get anywhere close to the asking price, Kim and Kroy's financial problems would be significantly helped.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kimberleigh Marie Zolciak was born May 19, 1978, in Pensacola, Florida, but spent her childhood in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. She was raised in a military family and is the daughter of Joseph and Karen. She has one brother, Michael. The siblings were raised Roman Catholic. When Kim was 17, she had an affair with a police officer. He had interviewed her as a witness in a criminal investigation.

She studied nursing. After graduating, at the age of 21, Kim moved to Atlanta where her parents had moved.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-186632 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Kim-Zolciak.jpg alt width=405 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-186632 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><h2 id=real-housewives-atlanta><strong>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</strong></h2><p>Kim joined "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" on October 7, 2008, and has been appearing on Bravo-related television ever since. In year four, Zolciak and her then-fiance were the subjects of a new spinoff show about their life getting ready for the wedding, "Don't Be Tardy for the Wedding." Kim left "The Real Housewives" in the midst of season five. Her final episode aired in December 2012. "Don't Be Tardy" has run for seven seasons with season eight set to air in July 2020. Zolciak returned as a recurring role to "The Real Housewives" for season 10.

Zolciak appeared in season 21 of "Dancing With the Stars." Her partner was dancer <a href=# title="Tony Dovolani Net Worth">Tony Dovolani</a>. However, she withdrew in September 2015 due to suffering a transient ischemic attack which prevented her from being able to fly.&nbsp; She has also made guest appearances on "The <a href=# title="Wendy Williams Net Worth">Wendy Williams</a> Show" and "The Ellen Degeneres Show."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-297084 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/kz.jpg alt width=900 height=572 sizes="(max-width: 1126px) 100vw, 1126px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-297084 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Kim began working on a country music album in 2008. The title of "Don't Be Tardy," the spinoff show, comes from Kim's attempt to launch a legitimate music career. Her first single, dance track "Tardy for the Party," premiered on the "Wendy Williams Show" and was written and produced by Kim's fellow housewife, <a href=# title="Kandi Burruss Net Worth">Kandi Burruss</a>. She promoted the single through a small club tour and even performed at the 2010 White Circuit Party in Palm Springs. The song was listed in the top ten dance charts of iTunes for a brief period. Kim Zolciak has recorded other singles, such as "Google Me," which she dedicated to her ex, Big Poppa, and "Ring Didn't Mean a Thing." In 2013, Burruss filed suit against Kim for profits earned from Tardy for the Party. Burruss's attorney alleges her client wrote the song for Zolciak and that Zolciak released and sold it without Burruss's permission. Burruss also sought a temporary restraining over to prevent future sales.</p><h2 id=business-ventures><strong>Business Ventures</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Kim launched Kashmere, her own luxury beauty and lifestyle brand. Through Kashmere Kollections, Kim sells skin, hair, and body products, as well as blended oils and spa accessories.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Kim is the mother of six children. She has two daughters from previous relationships, Brielle Karenna (b. 1997) and Ariana Lenee (b. 2001).</p><p>From 2001 to 2003, Kim was married to Daniel Toce.</p><p>On November 13th, 2011, Kim married NFL star Kroy Biermann. The two met in May 2010 at an Atlanta charity fundraiser dancing event that was filmed for an episode of "The Real Housewives." The two have four children together: Kroy Jagger (b. 2011), Kash Kade (b. 2012), and twins Kaia Rose and Kane Ren, born November 2013. In July 2013, Biermann officially adopted Kim's daughters from her previous relationships. The couple starred together on "Don't Be Tardy."</p><p>Unfortunately, Kim filed for divorce from Kroy in May 2023, after 11 years of marriage.</p><h2 id=atlanta-mansions><strong>Atlanta Mansions</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Kroy and Kim rented an 11,000 square foot mansion in Roswell, Georgia.
