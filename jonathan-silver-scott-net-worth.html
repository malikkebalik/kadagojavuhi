He first came to prominence as the co-host of the HGTV real estate program "Property Brothers". Today he and his twin brother <a href=# title="Drew Scott Net Worth">Drew Scott</a> oversee a media and home goods empire through their company Scott Brothers Global which reportedly generates more than $500 million in revenue per year. Drew initially wanted to be an actor, Jonathan a magician.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jonathan Silver Scott was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on April, 28 1978. He's four minutes older than his twin brother Drew Scott. The twins also have an older brother names James. They are the sons of Jim and Joanne Scott. Jim Scott worked in the film industry as a stuntman, actor and assistant director throughout the 1970s. When the twins were born the family decided to settle in Canada and carve out a more normal life.</p><p>Jonathan began performing in theater productions when he was in elementary school, and then went on to become one of the world's youngest international illusionists. In addition to performing, he also worked as a model, and practiced martial arts. Today he is a 13-time Canadian Karate champion.</p><p>They began flipping houses in high school with the help of their older brother and father (who built the family home by hand). They were able to get started thanks largely to a Canadian legal loophole that allowed people with no credit and little cash to takeover someone else's mortgage with personally guaranteeing the loan. They reportedly made $50,000 after their first flip and were addicted from that point on.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Jonathan enrolled in a business management program at the University of Calgary. While in college the brothers began dabbling in real estate investments. Jonathan eventually transferred to the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology where he became a licensed contractor.</p><p>In 2004, at the age of 26, the brothers co-founded Scott Real Estate Inc., a company they hoped customers would use as a one-stop-shop for their buying, selling and renovation real estate needs. By 2008, the company had over a dozen employees. In the meantime, Drew began pursuing television projects.</p><p>An early concept was an American Idol-like real estate competition show. Drew eventually found success with a production company called Cineflix which wanted to pair him with a female co-host on a show called My Dream Home. When Cineflix discovered that Drew had a twin brother, the show concept was shifted and Property Brothers was born. On the show they find good houses that are in poor condition and fix them up with in a tight budget and time frame. Jonathan typically handles the contractor/remodeling aspect of the house, while Drew handles the real estate sales.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-252915 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GettyImages-478473920.jpg alt width=594 height=440 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-252915 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>Property Brothers premiered on January 4, 2011. Within three week's of the show's American debut on HGTV, the network's ratings increased 77%.</p><p>Within just a few years the show was routinely attracting 10 million viewers per week, making it one of the top 5 programs on cable television for viewers in the 24-55 age demographic. By 2017 ratings had slipped slightly to a still-respectable 2 million viewers per week. Today the show airs in over 150 countries.</p><p>In 2012 the brothers won a Leo Award fro the British Columbia film and television industry. They won a 2018 and 2019 Canadian Screen Award.</p><h2 id=scott-brothers-entertainment><strong>Scott Brothers Entertainment</strong></h2><p>In 2010, before their show premiered, the duo founded Scott Brothers Entertainment. Over the years the company has produced a number of reality programs for television, film and the web.</p><h2 id=scott-brothers-global><strong>Scott Brothers Global</strong></h2><p>In March 2017, Jonathan and Drew founded Scott Brothers Global. In 2019, the company acquired the IP rights to Property Brothers from Cineflix. The deal allowed the brothers to control and produce al future versions of the show. Cineflix maintained worldwide distribution rights as well as a profit participation stake going forward.</p><p>Today they operate a growing empire under the Scott Brothers Global umbrella. In 2015 they founded an outdoor furniture brand called Scott Living in conjunction with QVC. In 2016 the company reportedly generated $100 million in revenue. In 2017 they expanded to indoor furniture, fabrics, home decor and more. Their products are sold in Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, Hobby Lobby, Lowe's and more. According to an interview with the brothers in Entrepreneur magazine in 2018, their combined businesses generate $500 million in revenue per year. This number was not confirmed, but surely the empire is quite successful.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2007 Jonathan married Kelsy Ully. They separated in 2010. In August 2019 he began dating actress <a href=#>Zooey Deschanel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvJqKWarJiWu26%2FyKWtnqpdqLCwwNNmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kurt-browning-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kurt Browning Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wordle-help-5-letter-words-starting-with-m-and-ending-with-r.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wordle help: 5-letter words starting with M and ending with R</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
