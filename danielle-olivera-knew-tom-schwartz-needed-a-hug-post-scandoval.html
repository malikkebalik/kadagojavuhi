Schwartz and Sandoval were both supposed to appear in the new season of Winter House, but only Schwartz made the journey to Colorado.</p><p id=par-3_28>Danielle Olivera from Summer House noticed how rattled Schwartz looked when he arrived at the house and said the friends could tell Schwartz just needed a hug.</p><p id=par-4_33>“He had so much anxiety and so it was like the elephant in the room,” Olivera told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>. “And he was like, ‘OK, do you guys want to just talk about it?'”</p><p id=par-5_19>And, yes, they did. “We were like, ‘Do you need a hug?'”&nbsp;she added. “‘Here’s a drink and a hug.'”</p><h2 id=h-danielle-olivera-wondered-how-tom-schwartz-would-be-post-scandoval>Danielle Olivera wondered how Tom Schwartz would be post-Scandoval</h2><p id=par-6_42>Olivera admitted to being pretty curious about how Schwartz would arrive at the house. “I was definitely curious as to how Tom Schwartz was going to be,” said said. Adding, “But I don’t know if that was excitement or just being nosy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_46>Sandoval said in one of his podcast episodes that he’d be allowed to still film Winter House if he filmed scenes for Vanderpump Rules alongside Lisa Vanderpump and Madix. He agreed to the scenes <a href=#>but was still banned</a> from going to Colorado for Winter House.</p><h2 id=h-tom-schwartz-hooks-up-with-katie-flood-from-below-deck-med>Tom Schwartz hooks up with Katie Flood from ‘Below Deck Med’</h2><p id=par-8_31>Despite being rather anxiety-ridden, Schwartz managed to woo former Below Deck Mediterranean chief stew Katie Flood. “They were vibing pretty early on,” Olivera told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a> about Schwartz and Flood.</p><p id=par-9_51>“[They connected] pretty early, but her name … It was definitely hard for him to get past a lot of things,” Olivera added. Schwartz recently went through a painful <a href=#>divorce from Katie Maloney</a>. So the whole “Tom and Katie” vibe hit differently. Olivera added, “I think it was an arousing success.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_51>Jordan Emanuel from Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard told Schwartz to just get over the name thing. “We were like, ‘Listen, You need to get over the name thing and just go for it. Have a little fun,’” she said. “We started calling her by her last name just to support it.”</p><h2 id=h-winter-house-tries-something-new-this-season>‘Winter House’ tries something new this season</h2><p id=par-11_34>Bravo’s Winter House began as a spinoff series that combined the casts from Summer House and Southern Charm. A few new friends were added to the mix to create a combustible wild time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_51>But producers decided to expand their Bravo horizons for season 3. In addition to a few Summer House cast members, the house added Malia White, Flood, Rhylee Gerber, Alex Propson, Captain Sandy Yawn, and Aesha Scott from the Below Deck franchise. Brian Benni from Family Karma rounds out the cast.</p><p id=par-13_12>Winter House is on Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqrrTnqlmoJ%2BqwKZ5w5qlop2cobJuu8uirZ6qkWLBsLmMrJqhr5Gnwbt5zZ6cnZ2UYrW2s4yppqysXaiworrDqK2apF6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./devon-bostick-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Devon Bostick Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alfred-hitchcock-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alfred Hitchcock Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
