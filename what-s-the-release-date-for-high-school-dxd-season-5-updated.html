That is precisely what the anime series High School DxD has done for several seasons.</p><p>The anime is based on a 2008 light book series by writers Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrator Miyama-Zero. The anime adaptation followed shortly, with the first season starting in 2012.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>High School DxD</a> is centered on Issei Hyoudou, a second-year high school student who is a bit of a pervert. Hyoduo’s ambition is to become a harem king.</p><p>Unfortunately for the student, his first date is discovered to be a fallen angel, and he is murdered. Issei is later revived by a demon named Rias Gremory, who also happens to be the school’s most beautiful student. <span class="mark_underline_79_150|hu%0 alerts-clarity alerts-markBase fs11c1t f104v4bm alerts-markHeightTall alerts-markSelected alerts-markSelectedFocused alerts-markVisible fofzirn fofzirn" data-mark-id=79_150|hu%0 data-order=20>Issei now has to work as an underling for Rias due to his resurrection.</span></p><p>Fans adored High School DxD’s four seasons of supernatural adventure/comedy shenanigans and the show’s colorful cast. Unsurprisingly, the series’s next episode is in high demand.</p><p>Thus, it’s fortunate that the fifth season of High School DxD has been announced via The Cine Talk. Here is all we currently know about High School DXD’s fifth season.</p><h2>High School DxD Season 5 Release Date</h2><p><span class="mark_underline_121_161|hu%0 alerts-clarity alerts-markBase fs11c1t f104v4bm alerts-markHeightTall alerts-markVisible fofzirn fofzirn alerts-markAnimated fmybbhk" data-mark-id=121_161|hu%0 data-order=20>Unfortunately, no official release date for High School DxD Season 5 has been announced.</span> The anime series’s new season was initially scheduled to release in 2020. COVID-19, on the other hand, threw a kink in those preparations, as it did with a slew of subsequent anime releases.</p><p>Ichieie Ishibumi, the author of the original High School DxD light novel, confirmed via Otaku Kart that season 5 is still in the works. He also urged fans to continue purchasing and reading the light novel series, stating that increased sales of the novel might spur the continuation of the anime series’ development.</p><p>If High School DxD Season 5 begins this year, it will certainly air during the autumn anime season, maybe in October. Otherwise, the following season might premiere in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/High-School-DxD-Season-5.jpg><h2>High School DxD season 5 Cast</h2><p>Although the official cast for High School DxD Season 5 has not been announced, it is expected that the cast from the previous season of High School DxD: Hero will return.</p><p>Yuki Kaji portrays Issei Hyoudou, Ayana Taketaksu portrays Koneko Toujou, Yoko Hikasa portrays Rias Gremory, Shizuka Ito portrays Akeno Himejima, and Azumi Asakura portrays Asia Argento.</p><p>Additionally, the same animation studio staff from the previous season is expected to remain for season 5. According to ComicBook.com, Studio TNK directed the first three seasons of High School DxD. Season 4 was, however, directed by Yoshifumi Sueda and produced by studio Passione.</p><p>Many fans were taken aback by the abrupt change in studios and style, and others were unhappy. Indeed, the switch prompted some fans to launch a petition calling for the series to revert to its season 1–3 approach. However, Passione and Sueda are anticipated to continue handling animation tasks for High School DxD Season 5.</p><p><strong>Must read:</strong></p><h2>High School DxD season 5 Plot</h2><p>There is no official plot summary for High School DxD season 5. Generally, anime series have followed the same storyline trajectory as light book series. Season 4, for example, was based on volumes 9 and 10 of the light novels.</p><p>The previous season saw an increase in activity as Issei challenged Sairong. This scene showed Issei utilizing The Cardinal Crimson Promotion, a fantastic and massive power-up for his Scale Mail.</p><p>However, season 4 gave viewers some much-anticipated romance, as Issei and Rias eventually enjoyed their first kiss. In summary, season 4 included a great deal but also concluded effectively.</p><p>Season 5 is projected to focus on adapting volumes 11 and 12 of the light novel series. It entails testing for Issei. Issei will face the Middle-Class Promotion Exam.</p><p>This exam correlates with the Devil’s strength ranking and would place Issei slightly above low-class if he succeeds. Along with testing, Issei will have to deal with Koneko, who has discovered how close Issei was to Rias and is not pleased.</p><p>Season 5 appears to have plenty to keep Issei and company occupied when it eventually launches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgaXxyg46wn5qso2LBqbGMq5ylnZGosm6wwK2cZp6fp3qptcahZKybmKS8rXnDsZtmq5WWwLC6jG5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-the-television-actors-who-have-earned-1-million-or-more-per-episode.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All The Television Actors Who Have Earned $1 Million (Or More) Per Episode</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kathryn-hahn-in-prada-at-the-critics-choice-awards-perfect.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kathryn Hahn in Prada at the Critics Choice Awards: perfect?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
