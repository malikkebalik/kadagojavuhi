But why did he murder Claire (Natalie Anderson), his wife, Maya’s sister?</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>Well, unless you gleaned off the fact that dear Joe was one mean, selfish, and manipulative soul, let me briefly rewind to point out that Claire was hardly the first person he killed for his nefarious motives. He killed his brother, Andrew Burkett, to keep the lid on another murder he played a big role in — frankly, given his track record, he didn’t even need a solid reason to drop bodies anymore. But definitely didn’t kill Claire because the mood struck him.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-joe-kill-claire-in-fool-me-once data-injectable=false>Why did Joe kill Claire in Fool Me Once?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Who-did-Joe-kill-in-Fool-Me-Once-1.jpg><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>You know the saying that lie once and you will have to spin more lies to cover up the first one?

Along with Corey the Whistle, she went after the company’s secrets only to discover Joe’s in the process – how he killed his brother to ensure that the murder of his schoolmate named Theo Mara that he committed back in 1996 (along with Andrew) remained a secret. Joe now had two reasons to kill Claire – to protect his family’s crime and those he brazenly committed.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>Call it Karma or straight irony, Joe meets his maker at the hands of the same gun (wielded by Maya who suspected him for a long time) he used to kill Claire.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All episodes of Fool Me Once</a> season 1 are streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moqKknKh6pLjAoqmeZZmjeqe7zqVkpp1dpLuksYyapZ1lp53GcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everyone-steffy-forrester-has-been-in-a-relationship-with.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everyone Steffy Forrester Has Been In a Relationship With</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jon-b-dating-jon-b-s-wife-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jon B Dating Jon B's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
