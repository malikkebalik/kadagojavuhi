His podcast has broadcast 999 episodes as of April 2019.</p><p>In June 2018, Hardwick was accused of emotional and sexual abuse by his ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Chloe Dykstra</a>. AMC suspended Hardwick from its shows while conducting an investigation. AMC concluded its investigation and allowed Hardwick to resume his positions in August 2018. Dykstra refused to participate in the investigation.</p><p>In February 2018, Hardwick announced that he would be rebranding The Nerdist Podcast to ID10T and that he would be leaving Nerdist since the contract with Legendary came to an end in 2017.</p><p>Hardwick's ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Chloe Dykstra</a> published an essay on Medium on June 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an ex-boyfriend; in retaliation for ending the relationship, she was allegedly subject to career blacklisting. The essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser's being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from "a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company", led readers to conclude it was Hardwick.</p><p>In 2017, Hardwick guest voiced as the villain, Klaxxon, for the special podcast episode of Futurama released on the Nerdist podcast.</p><p>Hardwick was previously engaged to model/actress <a href=#>Jacinda Barrett</a> and was in relationships with <a href=#>Andrea Savage</a>, actress <a href=#>Janet Varney</a> from 2004 to 2011, and with model and actress <a href=#>Chloe Dykstra</a> from late 2011 to July 2014. He became engaged to model, blogger, heiress and actress <a href=#>Lydia Hearst</a> on September 12, 2015, and the two married on August 20, 2016, in Pasadena, California.</p><p>On November 7, 2014, he hosted the "Talent, Art, Movie and Costume" section of the BlizzCon gaming convention.</p><p>Hardwick has denied Dykstra's allegations, saying, "Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her." Three former girlfriends and his wife all say that Hardwick has never been abusive with them. However, several anonymous industry professionals corroborated the descriptions of emotionally abusive behavior, with one unnamed source stating: "Nobody’s surprised. Everyone can think back to incidents with Chris that line up with something in that story." Another unnamed source stated that he "witnessed incidents in which Hardwick or those in his circle would make it difficult for those who crossed him to find work in the future."</p><p>Days after Hardwick's dismissal from AMC, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were revealed by TMZ in which Hardwick penned a lengthy breakup message to Dykstra as she pleaded with him to reconsider. The messages reveal that Dykstra had also been involved in another romantic relationship with a man named "Sam" despite her pleas to reconcile with Hardwick, and include an admission by Dykstra that she handled the situation poorly. In the text exchange, Hardwick tells Dykstra that "(w)hat you and Sam did was — no hyperbole — the worst thing anyone has ever done to me". Hardwick referred to Dykstra's apparent desire to reconcile as "just a way for you to have an emotional safety net to feel ok (with) what you were doing whenever Sam wasn't in the room with you".</p><p>He provided the voice for Green Arrow/Oliver Queen on The Batman and Lego Dimensions, Glowface in The X's, and Sokka in The Legend of Korra, as well as voice work for The Minstrel Show from the rap group Little Brother, and narration for the introduction video for the Flash animation game George Plimpton's Video Falconry. Between May 2013 and July 2016, he voiced "Craig the Snake" on Sanjay and Craig. He also voiced the character Vaughn in Telltale Games's Tales from the Borderlands, reprising his role in the Borderlands 2 DLC Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary and in Borderlands 3.</p><p>On April 30, 2013, Comedy Central announced that Hardwick would host a half-hour comedic panel show called @midnight with <a href=#>Chris Hardwick</a>. <a href=#>Thomas Lennon</a> and <a href=#>Robert Ben Garant</a>, formerly of Reno 911!, served as executive producers/showrunners. It premiered on October 21, 2013.</p><p>On July 10, 2012, Nerdist Industries was acquired by Legendary Entertainment. Hardwick was given the title of co-president of Legendary's digital business.</p><p>On February 17, 2012, Hardwick filmed Mandroid, his first one-hour stand-up special for Comedy Central in New York City. <a href=#>Jonah Ray</a> was his unaired opener.

In August 2012, he hosted a special episode of The Nerdist on BBC America to "debate" the effects of time and space with other friends and celebrity nerds.
