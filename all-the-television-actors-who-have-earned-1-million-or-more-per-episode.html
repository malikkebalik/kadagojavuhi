Not anymore. With A-list film actors making the jump to the small screen, salaries have absolutely skyrocketed. Prior to 2017, only a small handful of actors had ever earned $1 million per episode. In the years that have followed, roughly a dozen new members have joined the $1m club, with several members are well above that mark.</p><p>The three main cast members of "The Big Bang Theory" – Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, and Kaley Cuoco – all began earning $1 million per episode (roughly $24 million per year before backend syndication royalties) for the final three seasons of their show. That was an enormous&nbsp; jump from the $350,000 per episode they had been earning.</p><p>Impressively, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> has cracked the $1 million per episode mark on TWO different shows! She first became a member of the $1 million per episode or more club in 2002 for "Friends." Aniston earned her second membership card in 2019, thanks to AppleTV+'s "The Morning Show." She earns a whopping $2 million per episode. Her "The Morning Show" costar <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> also has two entries on this list. She made $1 million or more on both "Big Little Lies" and "The Morning Show."</p><h2><strong>Who was the first television actor to make $1 million per episode?</strong></h2><p>Jerry Seinfeld. He earned $1 million per episode in 1997.</p><h2><strong>Has anyone ever earned $2 million per episode?</strong></h2><p>Yes! A handful of actors have earned $2 million per episode, including Robert Downey Jr. (The Sympathizer), Reese Witherspoon + Jennifer Aniston (The Morning Show) and John Krasinski (Jack Ryan). However, all of these examples are limited run series (8-10 episodes) AND each actor also served as a producer on the show which comes with an additional salary?</p><h2><strong>What's the most money earned on a per-episode basis in TV history?</strong></h2><p>On a dollar for dollar basis, $2 million is the highest per-episode salary anyone has ever earned from a television series as of this writing. But there's a catch!</p><p>Back in 2002 Kelsey Grammer earned $1.6 million per episode of "Frasier." When you adjust for inflation, earning $1.6 million in 2002 is the same as earning around $2.66 million per episode today! And then two years later, Ray Romano earned $1.7 million per episode. Earning $1.7 million in 2004 is the same as $2.7 million today. So <a href=#>Ray Romano</a> is the highest paid actor in TV history!</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-235141 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sein-1.jpg alt width=594 height=422 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-235141 class=wp-caption-text>SCOTT FLYNN/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>In date descending order, below is our running list of all the actors in TV history who have earned $1 million (or more) per episode of television:</p><ul><li><strong>Kevin Costner for Yellowstone (2022) – $1 million</strong></li></ul><p>For season 5 of "Yellowstone" <a href=#>Kevin Costner</a> earned $1.2 million per episode.

In total, the three main cast members earned more than $100 million each from the eighth season to the twelfth and final season of the show. Prior to the jump to the million dollar club, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were earning $350,000 per episode.</p><p>Charlie Sheen made $1.8 million for the last season he was on "Two and a Half Men." Of course that was the year of Tiger Blood and Winning and all the things that went along with his epic meltdown. As a result, that season was cut short. Sheen appeared in 16 episodes of the improbably long running sitcom. For his trouble, he earned about $30 million. Sheen formerly held the Guinness World Record for Highest Paid TV Actor Per Episode.</p><p>James Gandolfini's salary negotiations dragged on for so long they delayed production and threatened to shut down the HBO hit "The Sopranos."&nbsp; As the fifth season was about to begin shooting, Gandolfini filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against HBO for, essentially, not giving him the $1 million per episode he'd been seeking.

They were then making $75,000 per episode. Every year Courtenay Cox, Jennifer Aniston, <a href=# title="Lisa Kudrow Net Worth">Lisa Kudrow</a>, Matthew Perry, <a href=# title="Matt LeBlanc Net Worth">Matt LeBlanc</a>, and <a href=# title="David Schwimmer Net Worth">David Schwimmer</a> negotiated as one and their salaries increased exponentially until, in the ninth and tenth seasons, each of the six main cast members were earning $1 million per episode.&nbsp; Over the course of 10 seasons, each cast member of "Friends earned"&nbsp;<strong>$88.4 million</strong>&nbsp;in salary.</p><ul><li><strong>Kelsey Grammer for "Frasier" (2002) – $1.6 million</strong></li></ul><p><a href=#><strong>Kelsey Grammer</strong></a> played Dr. Frasier Crane on "Cheers."

Impressively, the sitcom was Allen's first acting gig. He starred as a former salesman turned host of a home improvement show.&nbsp; "Home Improvement" ran for eight seasons. Also keep in mind that earning $1.25 million in 1998 is the same as earning $2.3 million in today's dollars!</p><p>Then in the final season of his series "Last Man Standing", which ran from 2011 to 2021, Tim once again earned $1.25 million per episode. And while YES that's the same amount he earned from "Home Improvement", earning $1.25 million in 2021 is the same making $680,000 in 1998. So Tim was working at a relative discount!</p><ul><li><strong>Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt for "Mad About You" (1998) – $1 million</strong></li></ul><p>It's hard to remember now, but back in the 90s "Mad About You" was a hot property with great ratings and a devoted fan base.&nbsp; Helen Hunt won the Emmy for&nbsp; Best Actress in a Comedy four years in a row (1996-1999).

But Jerry could have earned even more if he had wanted to bring "Seinfeld" back for a 10th&nbsp;season.&nbsp; Reportedly, the network offered Seinfeld $5 million an episode to do one more season.&nbsp; Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show. His co-stars – <a href=# title="Jason Alexander Net Worth">Jason Alexander</a>, <a href=# title="Julia Louis-Dreyfus Net Worth">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>, and <a href=# title="Michael Richards Net Worth">Michael Richards</a>, were each paid $500,000 per episode at the end of the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJorqGhk516tcKMmpqtp6Koeqmt1Z5knpmio7KleZBmpKKknJ68r3nPnqlmnaCewLCwxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-hutchison-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Hutchison Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-s-the-release-date-for-high-school-dxd-season-5-updated.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whats the release date for High School DxD season 5?
