It’s Ryan podcast</a>, where she told her side of the story. According to the Alaska native, the two entered into a relationship following their&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;win.</p><p id=par-3_33>However, a couple of months later, in Oct. 2021, she said she became afraid of “failure” and only a friendship. Even so, the 28-year-old claims nothing changed as they maintained a sexual relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_56>While Olivia noted the two started telling one another they love each other; she also pointed out they never had another conversation about affirming their relationship status. She then confirmed the rumor that Korey hooked up with Florita Diaz in Miami before they reunited in Atlantic City with the rest of the cast around Thanksgiving 2021.</p><p id=par-5_67>However, she maintains they were on a break at the time. According to Olivia, he seemingly distanced himself from her and lied about connecting with Florita. She claimed that she found about the alleged hook-up <a href=#>through Trina Njoroge</a> and Charlie Lynch before he eventually admitted to it through a video chat. The Alaska native said she has since forgiven Korey and claims they are still in communication.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Korey announced breakup around Thanksgiving 2021</strong></h2><p id=par-6_19>Shortly following Thanksgiving, <a href=#>Korey announced their breakup</a> in a lengthy Instagram caption, claiming he “didn’t want to believe it.”</p><p id=par-7_55>The 28-year-old went on to explain they split amicably and thanked his ex for showing him that he can “be vulnerable again and truly care for someone.” Additionally, he claimed he thought things were “perfect” when they left the island but noted they encountered difficulties in the “real world” that the two ultimately couldn’t overpower.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_44>Referring to the Alaska native as “one of the most beautiful people” he’s met, he promised to “always respect her and care for her.” He closed his statement by thanking his followers for their support, hoping it would continue to extend to them individually.</p><p id=par-9_19>After Korey’s post, Olivia didn’t acknowledge the breakup but continued posting on social media, resulting in criticism from fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fans previously criticized Olivia for not acknowledging their split</strong></h2><p id=par-10_39>When Olivia and Korey coupled, many fans didn’t believe she had true feelings for him. During a date with <a href=#>newcomer Andre Brunelli,</a> her behavior confirmed it as she kissed him and admitted she would pursue a connection with him.</p><p id=par-11_37>However, she ultimately stuck with Korey, and the two went on to win the competition. Olivia’s silence on their split caused many fans to believe their original suspicions were confirmed, and they began commenting under her posts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_32>One fan claimed he “changed” under a TikTok video and questioned why she uploaded thirst traps” instead of acknowledging the break. The 28-year-old responded, “you grieve your way, and I’ll grieve mine.”</p><p id=par-13_37>She then hinted at the cheating scandal by posting a video of her lip-syncing to a verse about a significant other cheating in rapper Cardi B’s “Through Your Phone,” fueling the rumors more.&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;is streaming on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZqCspJGjsW67y6KtopldoK6qv8SrZJ2dpJa2rbHDZqqppJmpeqy70Z6wZp%2BRo7G6esetpKVn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-horror-movies-to-stream-on-amazon-prime-for-halloween.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Horror Movies To Stream On Amazon Prime For Halloween</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./latanya-richardson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LaTanya Richardson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-carr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Derek Carr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-max-level-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide.html>How long does it take to reach max level in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-the-midst-of-1-billion-divorce-dr-dre-s-wife-is-disputing-their-prenup.html>In The Midst Of $1 BILLION Divorce, Dr. Dre's Wife Is Disputing Their Prenup</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-family-that-runs-carvana-has-seen-their-collective-net-worth-absolutely-evaporate-in-the-last-ye.html>The Family That Runs Carvana Has Seen Their Collective Net Worth Absolutely Evaporate In The Last Ye</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erica-fontaine-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Erica Fontaine Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD.
