Fans have gotten a chance to know the talented performer since he emerged several years ago as a superstar, but they may not know everything about him. For example, many fans may not know his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">real name or the story behind his nickname</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_49>It’s quite common for rappers to use stage names or pseudonyms, and this is true of A$AP Rocky. But what is his real name, and how did he get his nickname? Let’s take a deeper dive into the origin story behind his name and what his government name is.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-a-ap-rocky-s-real-name>What is A$AP Rocky’s real name?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_39>While <a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a> has plenty of fans, some may not know the true story behind his nickname. It has something to do with an acronym as well as his real name. His real name was based on rap royalty.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_41>According to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, A$AP Rocky’s real name is Rakim Mayers. If that first name appears familiar to hip-hop fans, it’s for good reason. He’s named after Rakim, the legendary rapper who’s generally regarded as one of the greatest of all time.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_43>The rapper met Rakim thanks to DJ Angie Martinez, who introduced the two when A$AP Rocky was a guest on her show. The surprise meeting seemed to truly humble A$AP Rocky, who showed respect to one of the greats who came before him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_30>Rakim even told a story about how he met a very young A$AP Rocky as a baby. According to <a href=#>Complex</a>, he said A$AP Rocky’s mother approached him in the street:&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember a long time ago, driving through Harlem. A lady walks across the street. I’m at the light, she walks across the street. She got the carriage and everything…She says can ‘you sign this for me?’ I never say no. I say ‘what’s him name?’ Rakim. I’m like word? She’s like Rakim. I sign the joint, I remember that day, cause that was the first time hearing someone named their son after me. Like I said, humbling experience.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_25>Much like his namesake, A$AP Rocky is quite a talented rapper in his own right. So how exactly did he come up with his nickname?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-does-the-a-ap-in-a-ap-rocky-stand-for>What does the A$AP in A$AP Rocky stand for?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AAP-Rocky.jpg><p id=par-8_49>He’s still a young man, but A$AP Rocky has had plenty of success in his career so far.
